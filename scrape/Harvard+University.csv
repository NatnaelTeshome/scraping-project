Harvard Political Discourse 1803.

By Reuben Puffer, D.D.

Reuben Puffer, graduated Harvard, B.A. 1778. He received the degree at Harvard of S.T.D., (Doctorate in Sacred Theology) in 1810.

—Quinquennial Catalogue Of Harvard University, 1636-1920.

It is, in essence, a superlative overview of the methods of either nation building, or national ruin one may find, and one can trace its application to similar concerns in  present political events.

Adams believed that commercial civilizations rise and fall in predictable cycles. First, masses of people draw together in large population centers and engage in commercial activities. As their desire for wealth grows, they discard spiritual and creative values. Their greed leads to distrust and dishonesty, and eventually the society crumbles. In The Law of Civilization and Decay (1895), Adams noted that as new population centers emerged in the west, centers of world trade shifted from Constantinople to Venice to Amsterdam to London.

In 1931 there appeared in a German scientific periodical a relatively short paper with the forbidding title ""Uber formal unentscheidbare Satze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme"" (""On Formally Undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems""). Its author was Kurt Godel, then a young mathematician of 25 at the University of Vienna and since 1938 a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. The paper is a milestone in the history of logic and mathematics. 

When Harvard University awarded Godel an honorary degree in 1952, the citation described the work as one of the most important advances in logic in modern times.

by Adrian Gambet and Gordon Cairnie; the
subsequent owner, Louisa Solano, a 1966 graduate
of Boston University, took over operation of the
store in 1974 after Cairnie's death. The original
owners were independently wealthy and were
able to run the business at a loss, giving away
books to favoured customers without charge,
falling behind with bills and turning a blind eye to
theft. Much of the activity at Grolier's under
Cairnie's management was of the social kind:
visitors lounged on a red couch while sharing
drinks with the owners.
Solano turned the store into a self-sustaining
business. For many years Grolier's has sponsored
an annual, national poetry contest as well as a
reading series in nearby Adams House, a dormitory
at Harvard. Solano's knowledge of poetry was well
known in the Cambridge and Harvard community,
and in the era before internet bookselling, she
was considered a valuable source for people
seeking rare and unusual poetry titles. Under
Solano's management, for example, the store was
the first to stock Language Magazine, the
periodical that launched the avant-garde
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement.
In March of 2006, the store was officially sold, to
Nigerian poet Ifeanyi Menkiti, a professor at
Wellesley College; the reason for the sale given by
Publisher's Weekly was Solano's ill-health. Menkiti
plans to maintain the store's poetry-only focus

Fortune Nwaiwu writes easily, clearly, wisely, and prolifically. I have been pleased to edit his book to fit the format expected by American readers, which I hope will be attractive to others all over the world.

My grand challenge is what this book is about, and the title of this book; Stay Strong and sit in an I AM ENOUGH confidence. Self-confidence is one of the subject's personality researchers and mental health professionals most like to study. Thousands of journal articles have been devoted to it, along with dozens of books telling adults how to raise their own self-confidence or their children's (Harvard health-Harvard University). Why is confidence, or lack thereof, one of the most studied and written about subjects in the world? Because at one time or another; we all struggle, no one is immune. It doesn't matter your age, occupation, skin color, nationality, job type, or whether you are a professional athletes, actors, actresses, or politician, we all struggle the same. In fact, it seems the more in the public spotlight you are, the harder you must protect your confidence.
I am here to give you hope from a real-world view, learned in the trenches of life and business. This is street smarts, not book smarts.

Parkman was a trustee of the Boston Athenæum from 1858 until his death in 1893.Parkman was born in Boston, Massachusetts to the Reverend Francis Parkman Sr. (1788–1853), a member of a distinguished Boston family, and Caroline (Hall) Parkman. The senior Parkman was minister of the Unitarian New North Church in Boston from 1813 to 1849.

These lectures concerned the nature of religion and the neglect of science, in James' view, in the academic study of religion. Soon after its publication, the book entered the canon of psychology and philosophy, and has remained in print for over a century. James went on to develop his philosophy of pragmatism; there are many overlapping ideas in Varieties and his 1907 book, Pragmatism. The lectures discussed the distinction between symbolism and reality. Symbols, such as the word ""steak"" on a menu, do not embody the actuality of the objects they represent. The word ""steak"" on a menu merely points to some slab of meat in the back of the restaurant. In a similar way, James posits that all of science is fundamentally detached from reality since the tools of science are merely pointers to some actual objective realm.",2012,English,9781105581427,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): William James,,,,,EPUB,"['the varieties of', 'religious experience', 'psychology of religion', 'comparative religion', 'psychology', 'philosophy of religion', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'mysticism', 'mystical experiences', 'pragmatism', 'states of consciousness', 'transcendental experience', 'peak experiences']"

About the author:

James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 – September 15, 1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the early 19th century.His historical romances of frontier and Indian life in the early American days created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William on property that he owned. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and, in his later years, contributed generously to it. He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society, but was expelled for misbehavior.Before embarking on his career as a writer, he served in the U.S. Navy as a Midshipman, which greatly influenced many of his novels and other writings.

Matt is the author of Haunted Historiographies: The Rhetoric of Ideology in Postcolonial Irish Fiction (Manchester University Press, 2014) and Joycean Arcana: Ulysses and the Tarot de Marseille (EyeCorner Press 2020). He also edited Postcolonial Star Wars: Essays on Empire and Rebellion in a Galaxy Far, Far Away (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2020).

Additionally, Matt has published two novels—On Coventry (Harvard Square Editions, 2015) and We, The Wanted (John Hunt Publishing 2021). His poetry appears in over 60 journals and magazines including 2River where his chapbook, Parallax, is available. Matt also has a chapbook and full-length collection forthcoming from ELJ Editions in May 2022.
Matt began studying poetry in earnest when he discovered the works of W.B. Yeats as an undergraduate. This led him quickly to the works of Paul Muldoon, Seamus Heaney, and Eamon Grennan, all of whom he pay homage to in this collection of poems that grew out of a want to enter into conversation with these poets. The first paradelle appeared in Picnic, Lightning (1998) by the American poet Billy Collins as a parody of the villanelle. While Collins mocks the form in a playful sort of way, Matt uses the paradelle to uncover interesting new images that he then twists into surreal narratives.

Willard teaches Christians about God's condescension to us by way of His covenant, and in light of that, how we are to live before Him. He covers the basics of the Covenant of Redemption, Covenant or Works and Covenant of Grace, to fully explain the biblical mandate and obligation to perform our duty in God's covenant. Christians cannot just profess that Christ is Lord; their outward actions must demonstrate the reality of the Spirit's work in their lives. He covers what it means to ""keep covenant"" with God, what a covenant breaker is, and how we are to use the covenant promises found in Scripture for our sanctification.

In any culture in any society in any place.
Portugali argues that in order to change the feeling of the environment and create buildings we really feel ""at home"" with and want to live in what is needed is not a change of style or fashion but an adaptation of a holistic and cross cultural worldview that will transform the mechanistic worldview underlying current thought and approaches. The Music Center and Library more than any other building designed by Portugali expresses her unique planning process and her particular interpretation of the holistic phenomenological worldview. A worldview which stands in recent years at the forefront of the scientific discourse and is tightly related to the Buddhist philosophy.
Nili Portugali is a well-known practicing Architect; senior lecturer; 
Researcher, published author& film director.  
Her multidisciplinary work both in practice and theory is closely connected to the holistic-phenomenological school of thought. 
She is 7th generation descendant of a family living in the holly 'Kabbala' city of Tsefat, Israel since the early 19th century.

It allows you to have the essential ideas of a big book in less than 30 minutes.

*By reading this summary, you will learn how to negotiate in all circumstances and in all serenity.

*You will also learn : that it is possible to protect your relationships while making your demands heard; that several negotiation techniques and tactics are useful to (re)know; that a few key phrases are enough to communicate your interests clearly; that a negotiation is successful if both parties enjoy finding common solutions.

*If you feel that you do not know how to negotiate, it is probably because its practice is associated with power struggles or a sharp confrontation of arguments. Negotiation is perceived as an intimidating and deterrent practice related to conflict. Wouldn't you be more confident if the art of negotiation was above all the art of interfering in the best possible cooperation? Roger Fisher and William Ury, law researchers at Harvard University, suggest that you try interest-based negotiation, a style of dialogue centered on each participant's interest, creativity and good faith. For them, negotiation should be first and foremost a collaborative science, designed to lead not to one, but to several solutions to a disagreement. Ready to finally negotiate properly?

It allows you to have the essential ideas of a big book in less than 30 minutes.

As you read this summary, you will learn how society can create innovators, the young people who will change the world.

You will also learn that :

Montessori pedagogy is apt to foster the emergence of talented innovators;
The idea is the essential raw material of innovation;
Intrinsic motivation is the main driver of innovation;
To think differently, one must surround oneself with models who act differently;
The word ""reiteration"" can usefully replace the word ""failure"";
Standing out from others is the main motivation of innovators.
Tony Wagner is an expert in educational sciences, currently in residence at Harvard University. In ""Creating Innovators"", he argues for the creation of an economy based on innovation and asks how to train those who will have to make it work, so that they all, as far as possible, become innovators. In doing so, he asks what parents, teachers, mentors and employers need to do to encourage innovation on a permanent basis. In short, this book is a fascinating journey into the world of those who are creating the world of tomorrow.

Methodologically, it proposes an alternative top-down AV-incorporated transit planning model that is populated by a bottom-up narrative framework: an architectural graphic novel that envisions this future world through the eyes of 5 distinct Angeleno archetypes as they experience this mobility paradigm shift first-hand. This manifesto offers a radical story that might convince the everyday city-dweller that alternatives to car culture can exist, a set of concrete policies that would enable this potential LA of 2047 to emerge, and finally a set of urban implications and lessons-learned for the design and planning of the city of the future. 

While the private car caused public transit to historically decline in the United States, we must now use the automated car to return us back to public transit as a model of urban growth. In envisioning this potential urban future and delineating the design, planning, & policy paths that one might take towards achieving it, this manifesto contends that there is hope in transitioning from the Autopia of today, to a Transitopia of tomorrow.

This is a big shift. Are cities and their inhabitants ready?

With first-hand knowledge, Cengiz Çandar tells the story of the emergence of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s revisionist Turkey in global affairs. References from almost 90 different names from around 20 countries, he also reflects how the international expertise on Turkey viewed Turkey.

“Cengiz Çandar has written a thought provoking and tremendously insightful book on contemporary Turkish foreign policy rooted in a deep understanding of Turkish history and politics. Çandar’s insights are grounded in experiences as a journalist and foreign policy advisor. This book goes a long way to explain Turkey’s strident foreign policy today. It is a wonderfully informative and enjoyable read!”

– Lenore G. Martin, Co-Chair of the Study Group on Modern Turkey, Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Harvard University, USA

 

“No one  better understands and  explains “Neo-Ottomanism” than Cengiz Çandar, who coined the term almost 30 years ago, long  before it became a fashionable concept capturing the evolution of Turkish foreign policy. And very few writers can so beautifully weave professional insights,  objective analysis and anecdotal flair. By transcending easy clichés and lazy analogies,  Çandar has produced a definitive account. If you could only read one book on Turkish foreign policy , this is it.”

– Ömer Taşpınar, ProfessorNational War College and The Johns Hopkins University (SAIS), USA

 

“In his new book, Turkey’s Neo-Ottomanist Moment: A Eurasianist Odyssey, Cengiz Çandar, a veteran foreign policy analyst, advances a lucid explanation of his country’s increasingly assertive behavior. His seemingly paradoxical conclusion is aptly encapsulated in the book’s title. Çandar’s book is an intellectual tour de force and a must-read for anyone interested in the intertwined problem of contemporary Turkey’s identity and foreign policy.”

– Igor Torbakov, Historian, former research scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences.

CHARANKUMAR,Ebook,20.67,"When Howard Gardener and others carved out their respective projects, he received an interesting assignment: to write a book about what had been established about human cognition through discoveries in the biological and behavioral sciences. Thus was born the research program that led to the theory of multiple-intelligence, according to its own rules in relative autonomy from the others. Howard Gardner of Harvard University has propounded a unique theory of intelligence called the “theory of Multiple Intelligence”. It first appeared in his 1983 book, Frames of Mind: The theory of Multiple Intelligence. Through his new theory, Gardner challenged the notion of general intelligence, “g” and then questioned the very basis of prevailing intelligence tests by asking how an individual’s intellectual capacities could be captured in a single measure of intelligence. Indeed, he tried to give a broad base to the concept of intelligence and its measurement by providing a multiple frame. He asserted that human intelligence or cognitive competence can be better described as a set of an individual’s multiple abilities, talents and mental skills related to a multiple number of domains of knowledge in a particular cultural setting. Elaborating his pluralistic view of intelligence further, he
concluded that there are seven independent types of intelligence that grow and develop differently in different people, depending upon their hereditary characteristics or environmental experiences. By calling them independent, Gardner meant that each intelligence is a relatively autonomous intellectual potential which is capable of functioning independently of the other. These different types of intelligence have been named by him as linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal and interpersonal (Mangal, S. K., 2008, p. 289).",2022,English,9781678151034,Education & Language,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Dr. V.

Even after being ran over by a car, downstairs can continue to function normally.
Ironically, a member of the audience learned that the ""Welsh Global Handset Science Specialist"" was actually a supporting actor. He appeared in a number of television plays as well. One of the most astonishing things about this cell phone commercial is that the actor didn't even alter his attire or tie; instead, he just magically became a ""Expert."" scientific study of portable electronic devices worldwide.

Published to great acclaim and fierce controversy in 1866, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment has left an indelible mark on global literature and our modern world, and is still known worldwide as the quintessential Russian novel. Readers of all backgrounds have debated its historical, cultural, and spiritual dimensions, probing the moral and ethical dilemmas that Dostoevsky so brilliantly stages throughout his narrative. Yet, at its heart, this masterpiece of literary realism is ultimately an immersive tale of passion and redemption?indeed, ""the best of all murder stories"" (Harold Bloom), ""most perfect in pacing and structure. There is no more gripping novel in the world"" (Michael Dirda).

Now, acclaimed translator Michael R. Katz breathes fresh life into this ageless classic in a sparkling new translation, with novel insights into the linguistic richness, subtle tones, and cunning humor of Dostoevsky’s magnum opus. Embracing the complex linguistic blend inherent in modern literary Russian that has provided an exceptionally fertile source of images and diction for Russian writers since the time of Pushkin, Katz recaptures the richness of tone and register of the novel’s most poignant and significant passages. Sensitive to this linguistic mosaic, Katz ably recreates the feeling of the original Russian for the English reader, allowing the text to evoke the same stirring emotional responses as the author intended.

Absalom, Absalom! details the rise and fall of Thomas Sutpen, a white man born into poverty in western Virginia who moves to Mississippi with the dual aims of gaining wealth and becoming a powerful family patriarch. The story is told entirely in flashbacks narrated mostly by Quentin Compson to his roommate at Harvard College, Shreve, who frequently contributes his own suggestions and surmises. The narration of Rosa Coldfield, and Quentin's father and grandfather, are also included and re-interpreted by Shreve and Quentin, with the total events of the story unfolding in nonchronological order and often with differing details. This results in a peeling-back-the-onion revelation of the true story of the Sutpens. Rosa initially narrates the story, with long digressions and a biased memory, to Quentin Compson, whose grandfather was a friend of Sutpen's. Quentin's father then fills in some of the details to Quentin. Finally, Quentin relates the story to his roommate Shreve, and in each retelling, the reader receives more details as the parties flesh out the story by adding layers. The final effect leaves the reader more certain about the attitudes and biases of the characters than about the facts of Sutpen's story.

Thomas Sutpen arrives in Jefferson, Mississippi, with some slaves and a French architect who has been somehow forced into working for him. Sutpen obtains one hundred square miles of land from a local Native American tribe and immediately begins building a large plantation called Sutpen's Hundred, including an ostentatious mansion. All he needs to complete his plan is a wife to bear him a few children (particularly a son to be his heir), so he ingratiates himself with a local merchant and marries the man's daughter, Ellen Coldfield. Ellen bears Sutpen two children, a son named Henry and a daughter named Judith, both of whom are destined for tragedy.

Henry goes to the University of Mississippi and meets fellow student Charles Bon, who is ten years his senior. Henry brings Charles home for Christmas, and Charles and Judith begin a quiet romance that leads to a presumed engagement. However, Thomas Sutpen realizes that Charles Bon is his son from an earlier marriage and moves to stop the proposed union.",2023,English,N/A,Fiction,No Known Copyright (Public Domain),By (author): William Faulkner,,,,,EPUB,"['absalom;absalom by william faulkner', 'absalom william faulkner', 'william faulkner absalom', 'absalom', 'absalom by william faulkner', 'absolom absolom william faulkner', 'william faulkner', 'absalom absalom', 'faulkner absalom absalom', 'absalom ebook', 'absalom epub']"

Can writing be therapy, or even medicine?

A vivid flashback from a sunny day in the park starts a stream of reflections.  
From attraction to love. 
From intimacy to doubt. 
From denial to collapse. 
The nameless characters get thrown into an emotional web of cinematic romance, therapeutic memories, and feverish dreams of hope and regret. Can there ever be a final chapter in an illusory plot?

Ola Normelli’s poetic debut is about understanding our own shortcomings. The Sole Medicine is the result of one year’s daily morning writings. The Swedish original, Den enda medicinen, was published in 2019, and was translated into English by Normelli in 2021.

“An intelligent use of language, where small-scale words shape epic emotions. A wayward kind of literature, bordering Charlie Kaufman’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” –  Reza Parsa, Film director & screenwriter (Before the Storm)
