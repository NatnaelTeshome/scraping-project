political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the
later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of
which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of
Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the
product of the schools rather than the product of practical,
pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings

Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand.

Print Wikipedia is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture towards the inhuman scale of big data. Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand. Print Wikipedia draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of date. It is also a work of found poetry built on what is likely the largest appropriation ever made. As we become increasingly more dependent on information and source material on the Internet today, Mandiberg explores the accessibility of its vastness.",2015,English,9781329316911,Poetry,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Print Wikipedia,702,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Poetry', 'Reference', 'Wikipedia', 'Mandiberg']"

Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the
product of the schools rather than the product of practical,
pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings
of morbid visionaries, is the material out of which these

The Legends of the Jews I,Louis Ginzberg,Hardcover,USD 45.00,"Volume 1- This is a massive collation of the Haggada--the traditions which have grown up surrounding the Biblical narrative. These stories and bits of layered detail are scattered throughout the Talmud and the Midrash, and other sources, including oral. In the 19th century Ginzberg undertook the task of arranging the Haggada into chronological order, and this series of volumes was the result. When God bestowed Paradise upon the first pair of mankind, He warned them particularly against carnal intercourse with each other. But after the fall of Eve, Satan, in the guise of the serpent, approached her, and the fruit of their union was Cain, the ancestor of all the impious generations that were rebellious toward God, and rose up against Him. Cain’s descent from Satan, who is the angel Samael, was revealed in his seraphic appearance. At his birth, the exclamation was wrung from Eve, “I have gotten a man through an angel of the Lord.”",2020,English,9781794851658,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Louis Ginzberg,410,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,['Legends Jews']

Print Wikipedia is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture towards the inhuman scale of big data. Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand. Print Wikipedia draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of date. It is also a work of found poetry built on what is likely the largest appropriation ever made.

The position of the Jews in Spain and Portugal during a great part of the middle ages forms an exceptionally bright spot in their dark and chequered history, and developed some striking intellectual and moral features in an age when a great part of what now constitutes Civilisation was wrapped in mental darkness. The favoured position of the Jews in the Peninsula induced a vast Hebrew population to settle there; and although it became evident, after a time, that their prosperity, attracting, as it did, the jealousy of the bulk of people, would lead to their ultimate ruin, this could only be effected in a long and gradual manner, and could only be consummated by a cruel and violent measure—their forced expulsion.",2013,English,9781300649465,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Frederic David Mocatta,,,,,EPUB,"['Portugal', 'Jews', 'Spain']"

At Jesus' time salvation was of the Jews because no other religion had the oracles of YHVH God. So Jesus came to seek and save the lost Gentiles, and the lost Jews.  Jesus brought reformation to Judaism, which changed under Jesus' influence - so it again would be a channel for God's saving grace.  And for the non-Jew, Jesus didn't come to start a new Christian Religion, Jesus came to gather that other flock (non-Jews) to his flock (Judaism) (John 10:16). so there would be one flock with one shepherd.  All Jesus told us to do for salvation, is what Judaism practices; keeping YHVH 'law and the Prophets' (Matthew 5:17-20) and to worship YHVH alone (Matthew 4:10). Those in the Christian Church do neither because they have been deceived by the 'most cunning of beast', the serpent beast from the Garden of Eden.

The Problem with the Jews at the Council,Léon de Poncins,Ebook,USD 0.00,"On November 20, 1964, the conference of bishops, archbishops and cardinals from all around the world, meeting in Council in Rome proposed a schema on the attitude and position of the Catholic Church concerning Jews and Judaism. Behind an innocent appearance of ecumenical unity, of Christian charity, of common spiritual affiliation and of the reconciliation of the churches, this schema implies an act of the gravest consequence, since it implicitly asserted that for 2,000 years the Church was in error in this regard, and that it ought then to repair and completely revise its behavior toward the Jews. This objective satisfied the powerful propaganda in those years by the spokesman of the great international Jewish organizations, which sought to obtain a “review and a purification” of the Christian teaching in respect to Judaism. This schema immediately aroused some violent reactions in the Muslim world and among Catholics of the Eastern Rite. John XXIII thought that this matter, required mature reflection.",2013,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Leon de Poncins,,,,,PDF,"['Vatican II', 'Pope John', 'Jews', 'Catholic Church', 'Catholic Liturgy', 'de Poncins']"

"Why did Jesus Say, Salvation is of the Jews?",Donald Werner,Paperback,USD 9.64,"What did Jesus mean when he said, ""Salvation is of the Jews""?  Jesus spoke this to a Samaritan woman who was not a Jew. At Jesus' time salvation was of the Jews because no other religion had the oracles of YHVH God. So Jesus came to seek and save the lost Gentiles, and the lost Jews.  Jesus brought reformation to Judaism, which changed under Jesus' influence - so it again would be a channel for God's saving grace.  And for the non-Jew, Jesus didn't come to start a new Christian Religion, Jesus came to gather that other flock (non-Jews) to his flock (Judaism) (John 10:16). so there would be one flock with one shepherd.  Jesus told us what to do for salvation, and what he told us is what Judaism practices; keeping YHVH’s 'law and the Prophets' (Matthew 5:17-20) and to worship YHVH alone (Matthew 4:10). Those in the Christian Church do neither because they have been deceived by the 'most cunning of beast', the serpent beast from the Garden of Eden.

-:The Holocaust remains as a reference to the destruction of about six million Jews. The collection of undesirables began in 1933 with the construction of the first concentration camp. As Hitler’s power grew, he rounded up others that he considered undesirable. Hitler had come into power and the slow destruction of Jews was put into place. In 1942, about a million Jews had already been killed. Execution was just one cause of death. Two and a half million have been gassed and a half million starved to death. Typhus outbreak killed many others after the Allied victory.

Jewish Prayers to an Evolutionary God: Science In the Siddur,Joel Yehudah Rutman MD,Ebook,USD 8.99,"Why do we pray? On the one hand, prayer offers us a way to meditate on the knowledge of God and have intimate interaction with a personal creator. And for many Jews, it offers a sense of community and fulfils a need for daily connection with a venerable tradition and language. Yet for many modern Jews, prayer is at best old fashioned—or at worst, no longer necessary. In Jewish Prayers to an Evolutionary God: Science in the Siddur, author Dr. Joel Rutman provides a new way of understanding the existing language of Jewish prayer, and he integrates science with Jewish liturgy—all the while striving to preserve the passion that makes prayer matter. The aim is to enable Jews to daven (pray) with kavanna (intent), trusting that science will not pull the rug out from under their prayer.

THE MYSTERY OF JEWISH HISTORY,Vladimir Moss,Paperback,USD 27.89,"“The  Jewish  Question”  remains  as  topical  –  and  controversial  –  as  ever.  Some Orthodox  Christians  speak  and  write  on  little  else,  considering  it  to  be  the  question, the  question  that  everyone  must  understand  if  they  are  to  understand  the  essence of  the  modern  world  and  of  Christian  history  in  general.  They  see  the  fount  of  all evil  in  the  manipulation  of  world  events  by  a  small  sect  of  God-hating  and  manhating  Talmudist  rabbis.  Others  are  shocked  by  this  attitude,  considering  it  to  be anti-semitic,  and  turn  away  in  disgust  whenever  the  subject  is  raised.  They  regard any  such  idea  as  serious  sin,  lack  of  love  and  the  prolongation  of  the  lies  that  incited the  pogroms  and  the holocaust. If  we  turn  to  the  Holy  Scriptures  and  Church  Tradition,  then  we  find  some confirmation  for  both  points  of  view.  On  the  one  hand,  the  Apostle  Paul  calls  the Jews  who  reject  Christ  “dogs”  (Philippians  3.2);  he  devotes  a  whole  epistle (Galatians),  and  large  parts  of  other  epistles,  to  the  threat  of  the  Judaizers;  and  in general  treats  the  Jews  as  the  main  enemies  of  the  Christians.  On  the  other  hand,  he writes:  “Has  God  cast  away  His  people?  God  forbid”  (Romans  11.1);  he  warns  the Christian  Gentiles  not  to  boast  or  be  high-minded  in  relation  to  the  Jews,  but  to  fear lest  they  themselves  fall  away  (Romans  11.20);  for  “hardness  in  part  has  come  upon Israel  until  the  fullness  of  Gentiles  has  come  in.  And  so  all  Israel  [believing  Jews  and Gentiles  together] shall be saved” (Romans  11.25-26). So  what  is  the  truth  about  the  Jews?  And  what  should  be  our  attitude  towards them?  In  attempting  to  answer  these  questions,  I  shall  adopt  an  historical  approach, beginning  with  the  Jews’  calling  by  God  through  Abraham  to  become  God’s  people, the  chosen  race,  until  their  apostasy  from  Christ  in  the  first  century  (parts  I  and  II); continuing  with  the  long  period  in  which  they  lived  primarily  under  Christian rulers  of  one  kind  or  another  (part  III);  then  their  emergence  onto  modern  history after  the  French  revolution  as  an  independent  political  force  to  be  reckoned  with  by all  other  players  (part  IV).",2021,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Vladimir Moss,311,Paperback,Black & White,A4 (8.27 x 11.69 in / 210 x 297 mm),,"['Judaism', 'Orthodox Christianity', 'Jews', 'Church of God', 'Betrayal']"

The truth is: If not for the coming of his Son Jesus, we would never have known about the “One True God” and the “One God sent” to save the world—
Jesus Christ.

Behold in this book the “40 BIBLICAL PROOFS” that the Yahweh of the Jews is not the Father of Jesus.

Where should the uprooted families go?  Would any other Christian nations welcome them?  Would they be allowed to remain in any one place for more than a few years?

Rabbi Gershom seeks to build a bridge of understanding between these two warring camps.

Why Giving Is Better Than Tithing,C.N Chris,Ebook,USD 3.00,"Since God is love, Why would such God wish to curse people who are under grace with a curse, call them robbers and destroy their businesses just because they did not pay tithe to religious houses as the law demands?

So tithe and its curses are Moses Jewish laws, not Jesus laws from God. The only law from God through Jesus is Love. God loves a cheerful giver but tithing is not cheerful.

Tithing is not by cheerful giving but a command with the law of tithe as payment. Those who are afraid of devourers or being called a robber by the God of Malachi can struggle to keep the law of paying tithe yet they are not Jews since sacrifice and tithes are not accepted from the gentiles by the God of Malachi.

The Message,John Thatcher,Paperback,USD 6.28,"Finally, a book about Noadiah - the final  prophet of the Old Testament. Her story compels us to see the days of Ezra and Nehemiah from a new perspective.
They were desolate days in Jerusalem.
The Jews had killed the beloved prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, but Ezra the scribe and Nehemiah the Persian appointed Governor of Judea, omitted his murder from their glorious records reverberating with Jewish lineage and self-praise.
It took the coming of Jesus, the light to the Gentiles, to illuminate the dark acts of the Jews -
""Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’...upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.""  Matthew 23:29-35
Stephen also said of the Jews -
Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute?
We need to see the history of the Jews through the lens of Jesus. When Nehemiah recorded that Noadiah and all the prophets were trying to intimidate him, were his actions right, or was it Noadiah and the other prophets who were right to oppose him?

This book also contains copies of some of his correspondence (draft letters, letters, postcards, and airgraphs) in their original language (English, German, Hebrew and Yiddish) providing a treasure trove of material for further research. 
This book also describes a number of incidents including what happened after the official Jewish Chaplain had the audacity to repeat his previous year’s Yom Kippur sermon on the following Rosh Hashanah and accidently omitted a page without noticing, while his audience did and that led to some ‘fighting in Britain’.",2013,English,9781304688927,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Moses Jakob Kasser,,,,,EPUB,"['pioneer corps', 'postal history', 'german jews']"

Hebrew Salvation,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 20.00,"Many among the Peoples in the West are to a significant degree of Hebrew Descent. In Ancient Times they had separated from Judah (the present-day Jews) and created their own Kingdom. Eventually they were conquered by the Assyrians. They moved via different pathways of migration to the west. The Prophet Hosea in the Bible described the situation today in Western Nations. He also referred to events in the past and in his own time. Megalithic Monuments, such as dolmens, were to be found in the Land of Israel. The Hebrews when they moved westward were told to put such monuments up along their route to serve in the future as evidence of their Hebrew Origins! It was prophesied that the Ten Tribes will re-unite with Judah. Many will return to the Land of Israel. For others the Lands they are now in will become part of the Holy Land! The return will be preceded by a War between the Ten Tribes, headed by Ephraim, and the forces of Edom. The Lost Israelites may have to fight against certain Non-Israelite Nations. Ephraim (i.e. the Ten Tribes of Israel) will repent. Rabbi Moshe David Valle, a Rabbinical Mystic in the 1700s, interpreted passages in the Book of Hosea as saying that Ephraim in the End Times will have completed his task.

The People of the Apocalypse,Evangelist Larry E.

By utilizing the Lord Jesus Christ's chronological unfolding of the End Times in Matthew 24: 3-31, each person or people group is studied in order to show their individual role in Bible prophecy. This Bible study method provides insight into how God will bring to pass His purposes during the last days. Many views of when the raputre occurs abound today, including the Pre-Trib/Pretribulation, Mid-Trib/Midtrib, Post Trib/Post Tribulation theories, and Pre-wrath/Prewrath. But the Lord's primary focal points of the End Times are His Church, His holy people the Jews, and His holy city Jerusalem.

Judenhass,Dave Sim,Paperback,USD 8.21,"I decided some time ago that the term anti-Semitism (a 'coined' term of late nineteenth century origin) is completely inadequate to the abhorrent cultural phenomenon which it attempts to describe. For one thing, Arabs are Semites as well and the prejudice as it generally understood certainly doesn't apply equally to Arabs and Jews.

It was in the early stages of researching this graphic narrative that I first encountered the German term Judenhass. Literally, Jew-Hatred. It seemed to me that the term served to distill the ancient problem to its essence, and in such a way as to hopefully allow other non-Jews (like myself) to see the problem 'unlaundered' and through fresh eyes. Europe and various other jurisdictions aren't experiencing a sudden upsurge in 'anti-Semitism'. What they are experiencing is an upsurge in Judenhass -- Jew-Hatred. 

So that's what I've chosen to call this story.

Zaid lived through it, lost his entire family to an uncaring German firing squad, and knows the truth. And if he ever questioned his own courage while hiding from the murderous Nazis and the equally murderous Polish farmers in a Polish forest, the questions were answered in the Israeli wars where he fought in hand to hand combat for his new homeland.

After this time, Jews became a minority in most regions of the land of Israel, except in Galilee. The area became increasingly Christianized after the 3rd century of the resurrection of Christ: Christians dominated in urban areas, and Jews remained in rural areas. Jewish settlements declined by the time of the Muslim conquest of the Levant. Then the forces of the First Crusade conquered Jerusalem and nearby coastal areas, forming the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Over the following 200 years, Crusader forces lost and recaptured Jerusalem until their final ouster from Acre. Then the Holy Land was made part of the Ottoman Empire, and Turks ruled it until the British conquered it. The region was ruled under the British Mandate for Palestine; but the pivotal fulfillment of prophecy came when the Jewish State of Israel was proclaimed in part of the ancient land of Israel.

Edward (15) survived the Holocaust by an audacious lie invented by his father: his mother, Erica, would claim to be a German foundling raised by a Jewish family. The ploy didn’t save his father, who was shot along with 98% of the Jews in Latvia, but it gave Erica the provisional status of an Aryan and her two sons that of half-Jews. The scheme became a cat-and-mouse game with skeptical Nazi officials; the family gleaned one temporary reprieve after another as they amassed bogus documentation of German ancestry—the author used his knowledge of chemistry to alter identity papers—always aware that one false step could land them in a mass grave. He tells this harrowing story with absorbing lucidity, with a simple moral vision—“I met enough decent, brave, and noble Germans and Latvians during the war to be immunized against prejudice”—that resonates. A testament of remarkable clarity and humanity, wrung from dark experience.

David’s Rise to Power,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"David is a living legend of Hebrew history, and this is a presentation of him from a Greek point of view: a view which found its way into the English language. David’s rise to power starts with the story of a man of God named Samuel. As a child, Samuel lived in a house of worship. The Lord singled him out as a prophet, and the child’s first prophecy was one of judgment on the corrupt priests. This was when Samuel’s people, the people of Israel, got used to being in constant battles with their most famous enemy, the Philistines. The Philistines capture the ark of the covenant, Messiah’s earthly gift to Israel, but when the Creator sends judgment, the Philistines return the ark. Samuel calls Israel to repentance, and then to victory over the Philistines. But that was not enough for Israel: wanting to be like other nations, they desired a king. Samuel is displeased by their demands, but God the Father tells him that it is not Samuel’s leadership they are rejecting, but his own. After warning the people of what having a king would mean, Samuel anoints a man named Saul. Saul enjoys initial success, but then he makes a series of missteps: he presumptuously offers a sacrifice, he makes a foolish vow at the expense of his son Jonathan, and he disobeys the heavenly Father’s direct command. That is how David shows up…and if you want to find out what happens next and how it all ended up, you must open this book!",2022,English,9781387559237,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,,,,,EPUB,"['faith', 'hope', 'love', 'David', 'Israel', 'kingdom', 'Jews', 'Hebrews']"
Hebrew Destiny,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 20.00,"""Hebrew Destiny"" describes how the Lost Ten Tribes are to be found in Countries of the West. This message needs to be spread. The Prophet  Hosea warned ""Ephraim,"" meaning principally the English-speaking peoples, against the dangers of Islam. Mohamed was described as a ""Mad Prophet."" Hosea foresaw that ""Ephraim"" would attempt to come to an understanding with followers of this person. The consequences are liable to result in disaster. In addition, ""Ephraim"" will be deluded and afflicted due to rampant sexual immorality. Hosea recalls how these same sins led to the Ten Tribes going into Exile. They lost awareness of their ancestry. The Phoenician Edomites of Tyre and the Minoan Sailors of Phillistia under Edomite direction served as agents for Assyria. They set up colonies in the west to work the mines and to grow crops to supply the Assyrian Empire. Israelites were taken in ships as captives to settle in such places. They were also taken overland to other areas. From there too, they came westward. Descendants of Ephraim are still to be found among Western nations and their offshoots. They are called upon to repent. The presence of many from the Lost Ten Tribes in North America in our times had been predicted. Judah will have remained basically faithful. Judah will be called upon to lead the Lost Ten Tribes back. The Ten Tribes will need to return to the God of Israel, accept the leadership of the House of David, and help rebuild the Temple.",2018,English,9781008993082,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Yair Davidiy,140,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Lost Ten tribes', 'Hosea', 'prophecy', 'America', 'New World', 'Judah', 'Jews', 'End times']"

Many Jews were arrested, some were beaten, and some were even killed.


The “Reich Crystal Night” (Reichskristallnacht) was one of the most shameful events of National Socialist Germany. Although the Jews suffered initially, the greatest harm was ultimately done to Germany and the German people. Even people who are sympathetic to National Socialism cannot understand how this event could have happened.

About the author:

Felix Salten (6 September 1869 – 8 October 1945) was an Austrian author and critic in Vienna. His most famous work is Bambi, a Life in the Woods (1923).Salten was born Siegmund Salzmann in Budapest, Hungary. When he was four weeks old, his family relocated to Vienna, Austria. Many Jews were immigrating into the city during the late 19th century because Vienna had granted full citizenship to Jews in 1867.When his father became bankrupt, the sixteen-year-old Salten quit school and began working for an insurance agency. He also began submitting poems and book reviews to journals. He became part of the ""Young Vienna"" movement (Jung Wien) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic for Vienna's press (Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung, Zeit). In 1900 he published his first collection of short stories.

Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians,Charles Hodge,Ebook,USD 2.99,"In the introduction to his commentary, Charles Hodge investigates the sociopolitical climate of the city of Ephesus prior to Paul's first visit. Ephesus was famous for its idolatrous practices of sorcery and divination. Upon arriving in Ephesus, Paul and his disciples spread the word of Jesus to the wayward Jews and Greeks, and many were converted. A flourishing Church was established, and several years after his visit to Ephesus, Paul wrote to the Ephesians while imprisoned in Rome. Paul wrote this letter to praise God for the gift of redemption and to guide the Christians of Ephesus in the light of the Holy Ghost. Several sections of the epistle focus on godly social interactions. This epistle was in large part intended to encourage unity between newly converted Jews and the rest of the Christian community. Hodge's careful scrutiny gives readers a newly informed look at Paul's letter to the Christians at Ephesus. -Emmalon Davis, CCEL Staff Writer",2010,English,9781610250948,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Charles Hodge,,,,,EPUB,"['ccel', 'christian', 'god', 'christ', 'christianity', 'spirituality', 'classics', 'christian classics', 'ethereal', 'jesus', 'religion', 'commentary', 'hodge', 'ephesus', 'ephesians', 'paul', 'epistle', 'church']"

Walking With the Wichita Pioneers,Barb Myers,Paperback,USD 20.00,"Different people refer to death differently.  African Americans call it home-going.

Hebrew Warriors,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 40.00,"The ""KHAZARS"" became prominent in southern Russia and its neighborhood in the 600s to 900s CE.  They were  powerful with a far-reaching influence and well-developed civilization. They protected the Jews while giving full citizenship rights to Christians and Moslems who served them faithfully. The ""KHAZARS"" converted to Judaism and henceforth were Jewish.
The Khazars were related to the Picts of Scotland and to other groups who settled in Scandinavia, France, and the British Isles.
Proofs concerning the Israelite origins of the Khazars of necessity also do the same for the nations they were of kinship with.
The Khazars were descended from a mixture of remnants of the Ten Tribes, Jewish refugees whose religious affiliation had blurred, and Gentile descendants of Gomer. A movement to return to Judaism began among them. Due to the uncertainty of their lineages the Rabbis declared them all Gentiles and then converted them to Judaism as the Bible and Tradition allowed them to do.
Descendants of the Khazars may still be found among some Jewish communities but only as a minority element and indistinguishable from other Jews.
Nevertheless, it is both important and of interest to know more about them.
The Khazars are symbolic of the Israelite People in general. It should be worth our while to be aware of this.

The Message,John Thatcher,Ebook,USD 0.00,"Finally, a book about Noadiah - the final prophet of the Old Testament history books. Her story compels us to see the days of Ezra and Nehemiah from a new perspective.
They were desolate days in Jerusalem.
The Jews had killed the beloved prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, but Ezra the scribe and Nehemiah the Persian appointed Governor of Judea, omitted it from their glorious records reverberating with Jewish lineage and self-praise.
It took the coming of Jesus, the light to the Gentiles, to illuminate the dark acts of the Jews -
""Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’...upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.""  Matthew 23:29-35
We need to see the history of the Jews through the lens of Jesus. When Nehemiah recorded that Noadiah and all the prophets were trying to intimidate him, were his actions right, or was it Noadiah and the other prophets who were right to oppose him?  
John Thatcher combines a lifetime of Bible study with great insight, to present the closing acts of the Old Testament as a warning to perceive that the things that are of God, and the things that are of men.

There are two rival historical-fiction interpretations of Revelation: ""Left Behind"" by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and ""The Last Disciple"" by Hank Hanegraaff and Sigmund Brouwer.  LaHaye's is futurist, meaning that most of the predictions will happen in the future.  Hanegraaff's is preterist, meaning that many of the predictions have already happened as the Christian Church formed in the first and second centuries.  Hanegraaff's book is handicapped because the average reader can't distinguish the real characters and events from the fictional ones.

On the one hand, the author traces the twists and turns of the life of the Brotmans, the family of a Jewish surgeon who survived Babi Yar in Kiev when it was occupied by fascists. They came through the purges of the 30s and 50s in Soviet Ukraine, but nevertheless decided to emigrate to Germany during the nascent new independent democratic society of Ukraine. The fate of the family was not an accident, but was a reflection of a certain historical culture and treatment of these human lives. On the other hand, the main ""character"" of the novel is the system and the collective historical subject of that system. The content, in its own way, articulates an issue of the collective people’s guilt in relation to the Jewish nation.",2021,English,N/A,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Kim Zaslavsky,,,,,PDF,"['jewish history', 'holocaust', 'holocaust in germany', 'immigration of jews']"

How Did A Hebrew Like You Become An Enthusiast of Yeshua?,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"This book is my way of saying that Zola Levitt was the best employer I ever had: I say that now because, since my time at Zola's ministry as his worker, God the Son arranged my life in such a way that I no longer had to depend on earthly employers, allowing me to fully engage in my heavenly calling.

David’s Rise to Power,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 25.00,"David is a living legend of Hebrew history, and this is a presentation of him from a Greek point of view: a view which found its way into the English language. David’s rise to power starts with the story of a man of God named Samuel. As a child, Samuel lived in a house of worship. The Lord singled him out as a prophet, and the child’s first prophecy was one of judgment on the corrupt priests. This was when Samuel’s people, the people of Israel, got used to being in constant battles with their most famous enemy, the Philistines. The Philistines capture the ark of the covenant, Messiah’s earthly gift to Israel, but when the Creator sends judgment, the Philistines return the ark. Samuel calls Israel to repentance, and then to victory over the Philistines. But that was not enough for Israel: wanting to be like other nations, they desired a king. Samuel is displeased by their demands, but God the Father tells him that it is not Samuel’s leadership they are rejecting, but his own. After warning the people of what having a king would mean, Samuel anoints a man named Saul. Saul enjoys initial success, but then he makes a series of missteps: he presumptuously offers a sacrifice, he makes a foolish vow at the expense of his son Jonathan, and he disobeys the heavenly Father’s direct command. That is how David shows up…and if you want to find out what happens next and how it all ended up, you must open this book!",2022,English,9781387559091,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,108,Paperback,Black & White,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,"['faith', 'hope', 'love', 'David', 'Israel', 'Hebrews', 'Jews', 'kingdom', 'war', 'power']"

MEIN KAMPF by Adolf Hitler - A demystification!,VED from VICTORIA INSTITUTIONS,Paperback,USD 18.42,"Mein Kampf is certainly a good book, which has various streaks of great insights in various locations. It has been written by a person of outstanding personal capacities and calibre. It is the work of a person who had the capacity to look beyond the parameters and limitations imposed by indoctrinations and herd instincts. There are various locations where it is clearly seen that the author does not have a frog-in-the-well insight on events, incidences and logical thinking, on various items connected to history, sociology and as well measuring others.

At the same time, this book and its author did also have a lot of failures and shallowness, and including that of a frog-in-the-well attitude on certain items.

The first item of its failure to measure up to book of universal appeal is its very basic cloistered and highly confined ambit of readership appeal. Even though there are various inputs, ideas and insights of glorious levels, the book is confined to a Germany versus others, Aryans versus others, Germans versus others, location. It is also localised by a very ubiquitous, Germans versus the Jews attitude, plus a totally anti-Jewish imputation everywhere.

At the same time, this book cannot be mentioned as pro-German book also. For, the book is full of accusations on German leadership, and there are many passages wherein the German people quality has been decried as corrupt, useless and utter foolish. If one were to not see the sentences that eulogise German traditions, heritage and various other claims of a similar kind, the book does actually parade German defects, German social incompetence, low-quality standards of the German leadership, and much more things.

He also accurately traces the history of how the Jews through history have been used as God’s instrument; how evil forces have for centuries, all the way up to this present time, sought to destroy these people, their mission, their purpose, and their unique position within the overall plan of God; and how the worldwide entrenchment of modern day apostasy, materialism and deception will immediately proceed the realization of these end-times events, anticipated for so many thousands of years.Such a work has long been needed that successfully marries the past, especially that of the Jews and of the rise of anti-Semitism, with the events of the future, and clarifies the mysteries of eschatology so that those of us who await the glorious return of our Lord Jesus, can more easily understand and appreciate the inimitability of the exceptional days and times in which we live—the End Times.

I begin writing poetry at a very young age, but I never got the courage to show my work.

Pan-Judah!,Robert Penman,Hardcover,USD 149.52,"Beautiful.  Disturbing.  Enlightening.

Beginning in the 1920s, a man named Julius Streicher published a small weekly German newspaper called Der Stürmer.  Its mission was straightforward: to warn the German people about the threats posed by foreign and domestic Jews.  The dangers were very real, and Streicher’s stories gave a blunt and direct account of them.

A key feature of Der Stürmer was its political cartoons.  The cover of every issue, and several interior pages, displayed cartoons depicting various Jewish dangers, in a most striking and graphic form.  The lead cartoonist was a man named ‘Fips’ Rupprecht.  His cartoons became the signature feature of the newspaper, and grew to represent the broader German struggle against Jewry.  

With the demise of National Socialist Germany, Der Stürmer and Fips’ cartoons were largely forgotten.  Or rather, they were buried—the victorious nations certainly did not want old Nazi images floating around, raising difficult questions and making people think.  

Recently, though, a skilled digital artist named Robert Penman rediscovered the forgotten images.  He carefully restored, colorized, and reissued them.  Here, for the first time, he has compiled 200 of the best Fips images, as they have never been seen before.

Penman has done a masterful job.  The images are sharp, crisp, and compelling.  The colors are stunningly vivid.  The effect is truly astonishing.  Fips’ cartoons, originally printed on cheap newsprint, come alive for the first time.  Every image is a small masterpiece, a true work of contemporary art.  And one each tells a story—a story with relevance for the present day. //

The Mystery of Christ Revealed: The Key to Understanding Predestination,George Smock,Paperback,USD 4.98,"It is one of the great ironies of history, that Paul’s doctrine of predestination which was intended to promote unity in a Church torn by dissension between Jews and Gentiles has since the Reformation divided Christians into two conflicting camps.

TESTIMONY: Temple Mount - 11:11 - Horn of God,Arlin Ewald Nusbaum,Ebook,USD 14.95,"From the author who brought you The Return: As It Was In The Days Of Moses, So Shall It Be At The Coming Of The Son Of Man (2014; an assignment given by the audible voice of God) comes now his latest assignment: Temple Mount 11:11 Horn of God – The Vision (2019) which explains why people have been noticing the number 11:11 (or similar iterations) for some time, which has to do with the Jewish people, Israel, and specifically the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

What was revealed to the author breaks all prophetic stereotypes currently taught of how the End Times are expected to unfold: no Antichrist, no temple he will come forth from, no invasion by Russia, no Mark of the Beast, and no projections that Israel’s “worst days” are ahead.

For Charismatics and other Holy Spirit-centric Believers who are waiting for God to “pour out His Spirit upon all flesh”—the prophecy in Joel 2:2 is actually talking about Jerusalem and God’s ancient covenant people first:

27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh [in Israel]; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy [Jews about the Messiah], your old men shall dream dreams [Jews about the Messiah], your young men shall see visions [Jews about the Messiah]
32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call [isolated instances throughout the earth with whomever He chooses].

Setting aside all reserve, he would make public confession in the pulpit, thus emulating the penitent Magdalene, his favorite saint.
We are not surprised that such an energetic temperamental nature, always ready for action and battle, did not escape reproaches of irascibility and impetuosity. Yet appeals to his sympathy must have been frequent.

CHRISTIANITY AND WORLD OUTLOOK,Dr. LI JIN WEI,Paperback,USD 18.99,"Within the first century A.D., a new faith arose partly within Judaism and in part around its outer edge. This faith adopted and used Hebrew Bible (Jews), called “The Old Testament.” According to Christian history, the Jewish establishment at that time had rejected Jesus and persuaded the Roman authorities to get rid of him. Resulting in Roman authorities placing Jesus on the Cross. The term Judeo-Christian subculture supposes a common essence shared between Jews and Christians. From that era to the world today, everything has changed. The world outlook has been changing since the beginning of time, and it will continue to do so. Along with the world outlook, the Role of religions is also evolving with the world’s outlook. On several occasions in history, Christianity and Islam were considered to go extinct, but in the modern world, they are the two largest religions. This book will discuss and shed light on the world outlook and its effects on other entities. Christianity has always been the centre of attention regarding the world outlook. Christianity holds the largest army and most of the world’s wealth as the world's biggest religion. Therefore, Christianity has excellent power in changing the world’s outlook and demographics. But, Islam or Atheism may surpass Christianity in the coming years. Most probably in 2050. We will discuss all such possibilities in detail later in the book.",2022,English,9781387675203,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Dr. LI JIN WEI,118,Paperback,Color,Digest (5.5 x 8.5 in / 140 x 216 mm),,"['religion', 'bible', 'education', 'spiritual', 'belief', 'outlook', 'vision']"

This book  will rock the Christian Church world-wide. He exposes how the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches have perverted the  Hebrew Scriptures to suit their  agendas and  created a counterfeit pagan Messiah, Jesus Christ.
He  proves how the forbidden fruit was a narcotic and aphrodisiac. He answers the questions which the Church and mankind have been unable to answer, the origins of evil, how could a God of Love inflict such horrific human suffering, and how can man, created in the image and likeness of God, behave with such selfishness and brutality.

Rereading Exodus Along the Anacostia,Virginia Spatz,Paperback,USD 13.00,"NEW LIST PRICE for 2023!! 

Rereading Exodus along the Anacostia explores intergroup dialogue, its role in understanding and addressing oppression and in envisioning new ways to get ourselves -- all of us -- out from under the millstone of racism and inequality and militarism. This book comes from Jewish tradition and from what We Act Radio calls ""the underbelly of the Nation's Capital.""

Rereading Exodus shares lessons the author has gleaned from DC's Cross River Dialogue, a small group of white Jews, all living west of the Anacostia River, and Black non-Jews living and working east of the river. The hope is that this book can help promote intergroup understanding and address deliberate attempts to weaponize certain topics, across our overlapping Black and Jewish communities.This book is meant to foster crucial conversations and to add layers to Passover observance and reading the Book of Exodus.

Lessons DC teaches about these topics and about Exodus -- and vice versa -- are not specific to one locale. Join the journey to explore connections with other areas...and to learn something about life and struggle in the Nation's Capitol, complete with underbelly.

HEBREWS IN THE MESSIANIC HOUSE,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"This novel is generated by the most famous letter to the Messianic Hebrews, which addresses 3 separate groups: 1) believers in Christ, 2) unbelievers who had knowledge of the facts of the Messiah, and 3) unbelievers who were attracted to the Anointed One, but who rejected Him ultimately. This fictional work has within its folds a series of commentary sections which jump out of the sacred text, and the soul who dares to travel therein will find himself continually beholding the superiority of Jesus via the Lord’s personality and His ministerial work. These facets are showcased by the writings of the Old Testament, which help the reader to understand the rituals and ceremonies of Judaism symbolically pointing to the coming of ‘God with us’. With a stroke of ancient bliss, the actions of Semitism end up casting their shadows of things to come in this literary world. In so doing, the student sees that the Good Shepherd is better than anyone else offering religion on a platter. All the pomp and circumstance of false religions pale in comparison to the identity, labor, and prayers of the Son of God. It is the superiority of the Son of Man that carries this story into every quarter of the cosmos.

Hebrew Tribes,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 50.00,"""Hebrew Tribes"" by Yair Davidiy describes how 10 out of the 12 Original Tribes of Israel lost consciousness of their ancestry.
Nevertheless, they retained their cohesiveness and are identifiable as historical entities.
The Ten Tribes all moved in stages and at different times to the west where they re-coalesced. Each Israelite Tribe may be equated with a specific Western  Nation.
This was how it was supposed to be. It is proven from Biblical Passages, Rabbinical Commentaries, History, Linguistics, Mythology, and other fields.
The Jewish People on the other hand derives mainly from the Tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi with minority element from the others.
The Tribes of Joseph dominate the USA, Britain, and related nations. Manasseh is especially evident in the USA, and was once present in Scotland.

Warranting N.T. Apostolic Interpretation,Sean Morris,Paperback,USD 6.68,"Prophets and apostles have been ordained by God to vindicate, justify, and expound the mystery of the Gentile Church Age as it is foretold in Holy Scripture (albeit mostly through inferior applications of prophecies that were originally & ultimately intended otherwise). However, there are yet to arise prophets and apostles to vindicate, justify, and expound the mystery of salvation coming to and climaxing with the Jews (and how this relates to the mass conversion of the Gentiles). After all, this was the original intent and is the ultimate purpose of these prophecies. The work of God among the Gentiles, commonly called the Gentile Church Age, truly is an after-thought (Rom. 11:11-25). In other words, it has been brought to birth by a repentance in God resulting from the fall of the Jews (God in the Ways of Man). This biblical fact has certainly been justified through Scripture, but in the process of this justification the glory of God in the Gentile Church Age has wrongfully eclipsed the glory of God in the next age. 

The Gentile Church of today has become wise in their own conceits and boastful against the Jews (Rom. 11:25), and herein they are blinded to the superior intent of the prophecies that bear witness of the Gentile Church Age in an inferior sense. Sadly, and erroneously, in the mind of a nominal Gentile the inferior fulfillment has eclipsed the superior! Therefore, the Gentiles would be baffled to hear a thorough answer contrived from the Prophets responding to the question, “how much more their fulness?” (Rom. 11:12), and, “what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?” (Rom. 11:15). The Kingdom of God in the Gentile Church Age is glorious, truly, but I marvel to see its inferiority, its ingloriousness compared to the glory that is to come (1 Cor. 15:35-58). I marvel to behold this after-thought work of God occupy so small a portion of Biblical Prophecy comparatively to the original, transcending, and ultimately impenitent purpose of God being foretold throughout all ages (God in the Ways of God; Rom. 11:28-29)!",2021,English,9781794899131,Religion & Spirituality,No Known Copyright (Public Domain),By (author): Sean Morris,39,Paperback,Black & White,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,['Bible']

There are two rival historical-fiction interpretations of Revelation: ""Left Behind"" by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and ""The Last Disciple"" by Hank Hanegraaff and Sigmund Brouwer.  LaHaye's is futurist, meaning that most of the predictions will happen in the future.  Hanegraaff's is preterist, meaning that many of the predictions have already happened as the Christian Church formed in the first and second centuries.  Hanegraaff's book is handicapped because the average reader can't distinguish the real characters and events from the fictional ones.

Where Christianity Went Wrong,Wayne Blakesley,Paperback,USD 10.07,"In just a few short years after the last of Jesus’ disciples had died (who were almost all Jews), almost all of the Christian leaders were now Platonic Greek philosophers.  These were convinced that the previous Christians were too simple-minded to understand the principles they (Platonists) were expounding.  All future Christian leaders were required to study Greek philosophy as a basis for their study of the Old Testament Scriptures.  They were interpreted allegorical, so that they would not conflict with accepted Greek philosophy.  Over the years, these false doctrines became so deeply imbedded, that eventually no one recognized them as false, and believed that they represented Bible truth.  This paved the way for drastic changes and errors in fundamental belief.  In just a very short time, Christianity had changed so much that the Apostles would not have recognized it.  These errors are still with us today. The practical effect of all this was that Greek Philosophy replaced the teaching of the Bible.",2013,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Wayne Blakesley,192,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Religion', 'Christianity']"

Jakob Wassermann (* 10. März 1873 in Fürth; † 1. Januar 1934 in Altaussee) war ein deutsch-jüdischer Schriftsteller. Er zählte zu den produktivsten und populärsten Erzählern seiner Zeit.Nach Abschluss der Königlichen Realschule in Fürth hätte Wassermann wie sein Vater, ein erfolgloser jüdischer Spielwarenfabrikant und Gemischtwarenhändler, Kaufmann werden sollen, brach aber die 1889 in Wien begonnene Lehre ab, weil er sich zum Schreiben berufen fühlte. Nach einjährigem Militärdienst in Würzburg, kurzer Tätigkeit in einer Versicherung und einer ziellosen Wanderzeit in Süddeutschland wurde er Sekretär bei Ernst von Wolzogen und begegnete durch dessen Vermittlung 1896 dem Verleger Albert Langen in München, der ihn in die Redaktion der Zeitschrift Simplicissimus aufnahm.

The True Jew,Llewellyn Smith,Paperback,USD 31.23,"Colored Interior:  colored pictures and all Bible scriptures in red ink.
My people suffer and die because of lack of knowledge.  The Bible is our original source of the knowledge of GOD. This work hopes to introduce to all nations the truth about the Jews.  The hereditary, history and reality of God’s chosen people have too often been misunderstood and distorted over the centuries.  Yet it is unknown to many nations on this planet today.  Yeshua the Christ is both the creator and king of his people Israel.  “The True Jew” must recognize him and accept his way before the Second Advent in glory.

From 1927 onwards, as one of the 32 elected Senators of the Union of South Africa, he attempted to mitigate the racist policies that many of his fellow legislators promoted.

HEBREWS IN THE MESSIANIC HOUSE,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 20.00,"This novel is generated by the most famous letter to the Messianic Hebrews, which addresses 3 separate groups: 1) believers in Christ, 2) unbelievers who had knowledge of the facts of the Messiah, and 3) unbelievers who were attracted to the Anointed One, but who rejected Him ultimately. This fictional work has within its folds a series of commentary sections which jump out of the sacred text, and the soul who dares to travel therein will find himself continually beholding the superiority of Jesus via the Lord’s personality and His ministerial work. These facets are showcased by the writings of the Old Testament, which help the reader to understand the rituals and ceremonies of Judaism symbolically pointing to the coming of ‘God with us’. With a stroke of ancient bliss, the actions of Semitism end up casting their shadows of things to come in this literary world. In so doing, the student sees that the Good Shepherd is better than anyone else offering religion on a platter. All the pomp and circumstance of false religions pale in comparison to the identity, labor, and prayers of the Son of God.

When they are isolated from the second-century Gnostic framework, they reveal many of Yeshua's inner-circle kabbalistic teachings. Scholars can restore much of the pre-kabbalistic tradition of Yeshua’s era through sources like the Sepher Yetzirah, Sepher Ha-Razim, and the haggadah preserved in the Mishna, Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds, Philo of Alexandria, and the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament. These were the Holy Scriptures of Essenes, Zadokites, and other messianic Jews of the period, including Yeshua and his disciples. The Psalms they chanted in worship and Shabbat Seder were not just those of our Old Testament, but the messianic Odes of Solomon and others preserved in Enochian and apocalyptic scripture.

Part of the reason why is because, for most of Christian history, the church was destined to be just like Samson: believers in Christ carried a Hebrew spirit bound to a specific occupation where strong drinks were prohibited and long hair was not frowned upon, but there was always the possibility of an evil woman giving away the vulnerability of the saints for the love of money. And that is what has driven some to betray the Lord, while most just simply desert the God who created them. Meanwhile, there are always the select few who stay faithful to the Jew who bought them with his own blood.

The Septuagint, more than the Hebrew Old Testament, clearly shows that the prophesies of the future Messiah refer to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and to no other. Also, the writers of the New Testament almost exclusively quoted from the Septuagint when they quoted the Old Testament within the pages of the New Testament.

The Burden and Blessing of Memory,Ann Jaffe,Paperback,USD 18.00,"Ann Jaffe was born in 1931 in a small town in Eastern Poland, about 75 miles northeast of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Following the partition of Polish land between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, their part of Poland was ceded to Russia. 

Ann was 10 years old when Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June of 1941. Within 10 days of the beginning of the war, the Nazi army marched through her town, moving eastward. Shortly thereafter, the rounding up and killing of Jews began. 

During the 15 months of Nazi occupation, she witnessed the brutal segregation and killing of most Jews in her town. Ann’s family escaped execution only because of her parents’ useful skillsets, and their extraordinary luck.
Transferred to a neighboring Ghetto, sometime later the family miraculously escaped into the neighboring forest, with the help of Russian partisan fighters. Surviving in the forest was brutal, but Ann did so along with her family, which included her 16-month-old baby brother. 

They hid in the forests of Belarus for 20 months without the benefit of warm clothing or decent shelter; the first winter they all huddled under an open sky and sustained themselves with a scarce supply of potatoes. Constant fear of recapture added to the family’s misery. They survived three separate assaults by the German military without being discovered. There were very few lucky survivors.

Despite the catastrophic events endured by Ann’s family, her story of survival also details the existence of love and resilience within the human spirit. She tells her story not from a place of unresolved hatred, but from a place of tolerance, demonstrating the transformative impact of kindness.",2022,English,9781387443994,Biographies & Memoirs,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Ann Jaffe,200,Paperback,Black & White,Digest (5.5 x 8.5 in / 140 x 216 mm),,"['Overcome Hatred', 'WWII', 'Antisemitism', 'Humanity', 'Family', 'Holocaust', 'Survival', 'Forgiveness']"

"The Apocalypse of Baruch and The Assumption of Moses: The Apocryphal Old Testament, Attributed to Baruch ben Neriah, the Scribe of Prophet Jeremiah",R. H. Charles,Paperback,USD 14.93,"The Book of Baruch is a Bible pseudepigrapha; a deuterocanonical work attributed to Baruch ben Neriah, the scribe of the prophet Jeremiah.

The Assumption of Moses is a Jewish apocryphal work concerning hidden prophecies that Moses revealed to Joshua prior to the latter inheriting his leadership of the ancient Jews.

Together these works constitute typical examples of popular Biblical texts which are extra-canonical; most Christian and Jewish groups do not regard their contents as true. Their origins are definitively proven to be several centuries after the time they purport to be from. However, theological scholars have expressed some interest, particularly given the time and context of the writing; being as these pseudepigrapha are old texts, they themselves carry value.

About the author:

Joseph Ernest Renan (French: [ʁənɑ̃]; 28 February 1823 – 2 October 1892) was a French expert of Middle East ancient languages and civilizations (philology), philosopher, historian, and writer, devoted to his native province of Brittany. He is best known for his influential historical works on early Christianity, and his political theories, especially concerning nationalism and national identity. Renan is credited as being among the first scholars to advance the Khazar theory, which held that Ashkenazi Jews were descendants of Turkic peoples who had adopted Jewish religion and migrated to Western Europe following the collapse of their khanate.He was born at Tréguier in Brittany to a family of fishermen.

The Assumption of Moses is a Jewish apocryphal work concerning hidden prophecies that Moses revealed to Joshua prior to the latter inheriting his leadership of the ancient Jews.

Together these works constitute typical examples of popular Biblical texts which are extra-canonical; most Christian and Jewish groups do not regard their contents as true. Their origins are definitively proven to be several centuries after the time they purport to be from. However, theological scholars have expressed some interest, particularly given the time and context of the writing; being as these pseudepigrapha are old texts, they themselves carry value.

In publishing this work, my chief object is to remove the general and erroneous impression from the minds of European and Christian writers regarding Islam, that Mohammad waged wars of conquest, extirpation, as well as of proselytizing 
against the Koreish, other Arab tribes, the Jews, and Christians; that he held the Koran in one hand and the scimitar in the other, and compelled people to believe in his mission. I have endeavoured in this book, I believe on sufficient 
grounds, to show that neither the wars of Mohammad were offensive, nor did he in any way use force or compulsion in the matter of belief.

The Haggadah for the Seder provides the texts and creates an atmosphere that encourages the recounting of how Jews were systematically degraded and then exterminated. This is our legacy to share with our sons, daughters, and their children.
The Seder helps us to confront tragic memories and honor our people together with members of each new generation. We emerge from the ritual strengthened by the realization that Am Israel Hai!

When will These Things be?,Geoff Barnard,Paperback,USD 18.00,"In this in-depth study of the Olivet Discourse, the author presents a view that is somewhat intermediate between the various schools of eschatological interpretation. The enigmatic nature of these passages has led to widely divergent interpretations and significant schisms within the Christian community.

The author’s basic thesis is that “the time of Jacob’s trouble” was fulfilled between the years of 1938 and 1945. The Nation of Israel was born out of the ashes of the Holocaust.

He deals with the Jews and Gentiles, with the Law Service and the gospel day, with prophecy and fulfillment, with the identity and preservation of the church.  And having laid a firm doctrinal foundation, he spends the next three chapters spelling out the way every child of God ought to live.""

Why did Jesus allow the devils to go into the herd of pigs? Why did Jesus warn the disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees and why did he refer to the feeding of the 5,000 to explain?  What does this mean for us? What was really behind Jesus’s commendation of the centurion’s faith and His warning of the Jews that they might not be saved? Why don’t we know when Jesus turned the water to wine? Why is this miracle important for us today?

Christians accepted the Book of Enoch as authentic scripture, especially the part about the fallen angels and their prophesied judgment.

Thus, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Jesus had studied and respected the book highly enough to adopt and elaborate on its specific descriptions of the coming kingdom and its theme of judgment upon ""the wicked"". There is abundant proof that Christ approved the Book of Enoch. Over a hundred phrases in the New Testament find precedents in the Book of Enoch.

Muslim Christian Dialogue,H.M. Baagil,Ebook,USD 0.00,"C. Why have there been in the last decade many discussions held between Christians and Muslims about their beliefs?

Ecclesia Luciferi,LCF NS,Paperback,USD 12.00,"Beginning in the 2nd century C.E., anonymous Christian authors wrote more than twenty books called 'Acts'.
They contained stories about the adventures of the first Christian heroes and the first Christian sects.
These books pretended to be history books, but the faithful transmission of historical facts was never their aim.
The historical background in them was to convey religious propaganda to the readers.
These writings were created in such a way that their authors used historical sources available to them such as: ""Antiquities of the Jews"" or ""Jewish War"" written by the first-century Jewish historian Josephus in order to weave in the adventures of their heroes of faith and their completely detached teaching about the afterlife.

Paul  Destroyed  Jesus,Rodolfo Martin Vitangcol,Ebook,USD 9.99,"Jesus came to set the world free with TWO BASIC TRUTHS:

1. 	That his Father—not the Yahweh of the Jews or any other gods—is the “One True God”;

But then came the Apostle Paul and concocted his own “Gospel of Salvation” that practically turned Jesus and his true Mission for the world upside down. 

Unfortunately, the world falls for his Gospel.  And the world suffers.

The Apostle Paul is the most destructive force that has ever fallen upon Jesus and his true Mission for the world.  The earlier we can resurrect Jesus from the Gospel of Paul, the better for the life of the world.

That black Hasidic lady,Sara Braun,Ebook,USD 16.93,"Driven by strength, resilience, and boldness, nothing could hold back this fluent Yiddish-speaking dark Jewish woman from what her heart sought out the most: a profound connection with Judaism.

Sara grew up in a small village in the Netherlands, Europe, and what set her apart from the people around her, and even her family, was her rich dark skin. Hasidic Judaism was deeply embedded in her lineage, but with Sara's mom being darker than the rest of the family, she didn't practice the religion due to the subtle but stinging discrimination she faced. Still, Sara had this unfathomable desire deep inside that she needed to quench. 
After an enlightening vacation to New York City, Sara saw herself living there and seeking out her Hasidic Jewish connections. True to her vision, she moved to New York when she was 18 with just $400 in her possession and one mission in mind: to intertwine her body, soul, and mind with Judaism. 
Now, she is a dark, Jewish, in-born opera singer, all alone in the city that never sleeps.
Will she find what she's looking for, or will New York become a hill too steep to climb?

It is said that we are victims of our circumstances, but how accurate is this statement? The truth is, it's all about perspective. When you limit yourself to your circumstances, you can only go as far as the confines you've set for yourself. But when you take control and create your own life, you hold the power to become whoever you desire. And this is the power Sara sought.

About the author:

Olive Schreiner (24 March 1855 – 11 December 1920) was a South African author, anti-war campaigner and intellectual. She is best remembered today for her novel The Story of an African Farm which has been highly acclaimed since its first publication in 1883 for the bold manner in which it deals with some of the burning issues of the day, including agnosticism, existential independence, individualism, the professional aspirations of women, and the elemental nature of life on the colonial frontier. In more recent studies she has also been identified as an advocate for those sidelined by the forces of British Imperialism, such as the Afrikaners, and later other South African groups like Blacks, Jews and Indians – to name but a few.

The question why there are specific symphonies called by the names of countries and nations has been on my mind ever since I was in my teens. There are Italian, Scottish and other symphonies. Why is there no Jewish one? – or maybe there is one, however I may not know this music.  Therefore I have thought a lot about composing Jewish music for organ.  After the deep upset at the assassination of our Israeli Prime Minister Jitzhak Rabin In the year 1995, I started composing “Mourning Jitzhak Rabin”. Encouraged by my friends and my public's response I continued my composing activities.  The present organ symphony in E-flat minor is a “symphony-question”, that is the question about the uncertain, incomprehensible, inscrutable, undetermined position of the Jews in our world.

About the author:

Grace Aguilar (2 June 1816 – 16 September 1847) was an English novelist, poet and writer on Jewish history and religion. Although she had been writing since childhood, much of her work was published posthumously. Among those are her best known works, the novels Home Influence and A Mother's Recompense.Aguilar was the eldest child of Sephardic Jewish refugees from Portugal who settled in the London Borough of Hackney. An early illness resulted in her being educated by her parents, especially her mother, who taught her the tenets of Judaism. Later, her father taught the history of Spanish and Portuguese Jews during his own bout with tuberculosis which had led the family to move to the English coast.

Abraham and the Hebrews and the True God,Ja'Son Elijah,Paperback,USD 25.00,"The Bible comes from God, so the Bible is His'story, so it can be looked at, God is talking to the reader. Abraham, was the grandson of Noah and Abraham was the friend of the True God. Abraham, is the patriarch of 2/3 (two-thirds) of the world's religion's. 

So why are there a dozen names for God, when you include Muslim, Judaism and Christianity? 
If you are a child of Abraham, if you worship the True God, this Book will help you understand and guide you to the cramped and narrow gate, and the road that leads off into life.

The two most life-saving scriptures are Romans Chapter 10: verse 13 and the second most life-saving scripture is John Chapter 3: verse 18.

Jacob, the son of Isaac, became an apostate, he wrestled with an Angel, who expressed concern over dawns light, Jacob, demanded he receive a new name. The Devil called him Israel, and told Jacob in Genesis chapter 31; verse 13, the Devil laid claim to the True God of Bethel.

The Prophet Amos; prophesied at Amos Chapter 5 verse 5 that we should not search for Bethel and Bethel will come to nothing.

Jacob lamented to his mother, that if Isaac knew, that Jacob had mocked his father, and deceived Esau as he did his father Isaac, then Jacob would receive a curse instead of a blessing, but Jacob still went thru an attempted to deceive the True God, by deceiving his father Isaac. Did Jacob, really think the True God, would be deceived?

So if Israel or Jacob was cursed, why do many people still think Israel represents God's Children? The Jews of Israel completed the sin of Jacob, who like Cain murdered a righteous man. Cain killed Able and Jacob aka Israel and the Jews killed the Christ.

They have been used to protect and to harm, and in both the practice and avoidance of witchcraft and sorcery. They are made of wood and stone, clay, metal, plants and dead animals. They are carved into crude shapes and in the most exquisite forms. They may also be composed entirely of words, which are believed to have great power and magical properties.

Used by pagans, Christians, Jews and followers of every faith and tradition known across the world, they are considered direct links to the gods and local spirits. All are links to the supernatural.

Le Havre: A Riveting Exposé for Our World Today. The French Résistance World War II. A Historical War Romance Novel,Pierre Gerard,Paperback,USD 17.95,"Merriam Press Historical Fiction. The late Pierre Gerard's historical war romance poignantly portrays the atrocities of war and what happens when individuals and nations ignore, unite with or combat those whose deliberate and declared intent is to intimidate, persecute, dominate and annihilate other people and countries. We learn about the boundless bravery that was France’s salvation during those terrifying, turbulent years.

About the author:

Olive Schreiner (24 March 1855 – 11 December 1920) was a South African author, anti-war campaigner and intellectual. She is best remembered today for her novel The Story of an African Farm which has been highly acclaimed since its first publication in 1883 for the bold manner in which it deals with some of the burning issues of the day, including agnosticism, existential independence, individualism, the professional aspirations of women, and the elemental nature of life on the colonial frontier. In more recent studies she has also been identified as an advocate for those sidelined by the forces of British Imperialism, such as the Afrikaners, and later other South African groups like Blacks, Jews and Indians – to name but a few.

Samuel Brohl & Co.
Charles Victor Cherbuliez was born in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1829, studied history and philosophy in Paris, Bonn and Berlin and travelled widely, gathering material that he used in social and political essays and also in fiction. He won fame with his first novel, ""Count Kostia,"" published in 1863. After that date his romances followed in quick succession. Embodying extravagant adventures, they must be classed nevertheless in the category of the sentimental novel to which the writings of Sand and Feuillet belong. Cherbuliez is always an interesting story-teller and an ingenious artificer of plot, but his psychology is conventional and his descriptive passages superficial though clever. ""Samuel Brohl & Co.,"" published in 1877, illustrates his power of drawing cosmopolitan types, Russians, Poles, English, Germans and Jews, which he portrays in all his novels.

Their standard answer has been that they were victims of their enemies – that their entire history has been plagued by enemies who are out to destroy them.

The Shoestring Letters - A Tribute to the Immigrant,Edgar B. Madsen,Ebook,USD 0.00,"Kierkegaard said:  “To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose oneself.”  This is an account of Danish immigrants who took that risk, embracing America to satisfy the inner cry which Isak Dinesen voiced:  “Give me a chance to do my very best.”  Sprinkled with humor, history and poetry, this is more than a tale of one family’s struggle.  The greater immigrant community’s wartime military service is recalled and the way Danes across America vigorously joined hands for their homeland’s postwar restoration.   Unforgettable is the photo of a defeated war machine slinking back to Germany after Denmark gloriously defied Hitler, rescuing thousands of Jews from deportation to death camps.   This book is a celebration of the culture, religious faith, and grit, which sustained Danes through generations of economic upheaval, wars, and migration.

Such an event was not a sudden thing. Laws were enacted in ancient Babylon to control black witchcraft and magic. The same incantations and spells used by black witches were not only allowed but encouraged when performed by healers.This study is about the continuous practice of magic by pagans, Jews and Christians. Christians think of Jesus as the Savior of Mankind and the champion of good over evil. However, the first Christians viewed Jesus in a much different way. A bowl dating from the 1st century CE was discovered in 2008 in the underwater ruins of an ancient harbor. On the bowl was an engraving interpreted to read “by Christ the magician.” That Jesus was widely regarded as a magician during his time has been quietly and effectively swept under the carpet.",2010,English,9780557399321,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Gary R.

Until that time there were only rolls (books) not organized in a prearranged canon. In the formation of the text, the rabbinate of Jerusalem excluded several books: Samaritans accepted only the Pentateuch (the Torah, i.e. the first five books) attributable to Moses, plus the book of Joshua. The remaining books, accepted by the Jews, were not considered as inspired by God, in the opinion of the Samaritans, and therefore not deserving of becoming part of the Bible.

Abraham: The World's First Psychopath,Adam Weishaupt,Ebook,USD 5.99,"If you consider it impossible that the morally perfect God would order a father to make a human sacrifice of his innocent son for no reason other than to demonstrate absolute, mindless obedience, then the God of Abraham cannot be God. So who is he? The ancient Gnostics had the obvious answer - he's Satan. Doesn't that explain the horrific history of the Abrahamic religions and their grotesque propensity for violence? Abrahamism is a terrorist religion, led by a terrorist God who demands unwavering obedience even when it contradicts morality. The Jews, Christians and Muslims who trace their common ancestry to Abraham are thus revealed as Devil worshippers.

This book provides a theological dissection of the tale of Abraham from the Jewish, Christian and Muslim perspectives. It reveals Abraham as one of the most evil men in history and unquestionably the world's first psychopath. Like the Nazis, he put obedience to a tyrannical monster above human life.

The Word of God is Not Held Captive,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 20.00,"This book contains what I call the holy blood words of Yeshua, known to some as Jesus. It is some of the Good News words desperately needed by the world. The illustrations are inspired by that Good News. The words you see in this document are my rendition, inspired by the greatest Gentile Bible translation of England; the holy words are typed out and pondered, allowing meditation to bring forth creativity. These are words which I have read faithfully since I was a child. These are words which have gotten me through the darkest of times. What follows is part of the word of God, which lives in those you love him. I have sought to introduce readers to new ways of seeing the many facets of the face of the Prince of Peace - plus, this book would not be unique if I refused to insert my personality into it, a personality which the Wonderful Counselor felt fit to place into this world in 1971. Therefore I have a total disregard for sophisticated grammar. What is more, I am a big believer in keeping the modern world tied to the ancient cultures, because as we can all agree: mankind since Adam has been getting worse, not better; but scientists today try very hard to convince the world that mankind has gotten better since ancient days. Our consciences, given to us by the God of Israel, show us the mirror of our hearts. This literature you see here is our Lord's words lifted off the pages of Holy Writ and examined for their own merits, apart from the words of men. Though the words of men in the Bible are necessary, I found it necessary to place the words of the New Testament's I AM under a microscope for the benefit of myself and mankind. Consider this literary work of mine to be a sacred bridge between the ancient world and the modern, a holy connection between Gentiles who are without hope and the national anthem of the commonwealth of Israel.

How Did A Hebrew Like You Become An Enthusiast of Yeshua?,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 20.00,"This book is my way of saying that Zola Levitt was the best employer I ever had: I say that now because, since my time at Zola's ministry as his worker, God the Son arranged my life in such a way that I no longer had to depend on earthly employers, allowing me to fully engage in my heavenly calling. The reason why I worked for Zola was because he ended up being one of the best teachers I ever knew. I felt it was time to resurrect a story which has been partially hidden for a long time. Zola is dead now, but he is dancing in heaven.

Ivanhoe,Walter Scott,Paperback,USD 23.72,"Ivanhoe: A Romance (/ˈaɪvənˌhoʊ/) is a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, first published in late 1819 in three volumes. At the time it was written it represented a shift by Scott away from fairly realistic novels set in Scotland in the comparatively recent past, to a somewhat fanciful depiction of medieval England. It has proved to be one of the best known and most influential of Scott's novels.

Ivanhoe is set in 12th-century England with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial and divisions between Jews and Christians. It has been credited for increasing interest in romance and medievalism; John Henry Newman claimed Scott ""had first turned men's minds in the direction of the Middle Ages"", while Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin made similar assertions of Scott's overwhelming influence over the revival, based primarily on the publication of this novel.

The book starts with the rise and fall of ISIS and how the major source of their recruitment was their End Time ideology. 

The End of days battle is centered round the Temple Mount. Temple Mount is the most sacred and contested holy estate where Solomon and Herod built their Temples, where the Dome of the Rock now stands -- and where both Jewish extremists and millions of Christian fundamentalists expect the Third Temple to be built soon. This volatile situation has created troubled relationships among Arabs and Jews in Israel. Any attempt to spark the End by clearing the ground for the Temple, therefore, can ignite gruesome holy wars leading towards Armageddon.

The first part (Moab - L'Alliance) depicts Moses' pact with God: that the Jews will obey His law if He allows them passage across the river Jordan to the promised land.

In Matthew, we see Jesus as the Son of David, King of the Jews. In Mark, Jesus is presented as the Servant of Jehovah. In Luke, we see Jesus as the Son of Man, Adam's descendent. Finally, John presents Jesus as the Son of God, emphasizing Jesus' relationship with the Divine. Christ fulfilled four distinct roles during his time on earth, and these four roles are illustrated in the four distinct Gospels.

As an author, he was known for his huge output.Farjeon was born in London to Dinah Levy and Jacob Farjeon, Orthodox Jews. He was raised in Whitechapel and had no formal secular education. At fourteen, he entered the office of the Nonconformist, a Christian journal, to learn the printing trade. He broke away from the strict faith of his father and in 1854 immigrated to Australia. During the voyage he was moved from steerage to cabin class because he had produced some numbers of a ship newspaper, the Ocean Record.Farjeon worked as a gold miner in Victoria (Australia), started a newspaper, then went to New Zealand in 1861.

The young man was apparently a believer in God, but when Jesus challenged him to give up all his wealth and follow Him, the young rich man found himself unable to make so great a sacrifice.

It is my testimony that everyone who hears the voice of the Lord—by Him, through the scriptures, or by one of His servants—has the opportunity to repent and change their lives.

Книга прозы Павла Лемберского «Река No 7» производит сильное впечатление. С ней на авансцену выходит один из немногих новых писателей самовыражения. Гротескность его мира говорит прежде всего о том, что в нем нет фальши.

Проза живущего ныне в Нью-Йорке Павла Лемберского занимательна в первую очередь возрождением будто уже и не поддающейся возрождению традиции, точнее — даже тенденции, охватывающей несколько традиций, от Бабеля до Аксенова и Юза Алешковского: писатель с какой-то неимоверной свободой совмещает авантюрный сюжет с гипертрофированным стилистическим потоком; лексическое буйство и повествовательный напор не взаимоуничтожаются, но создают единый стилистическо-нарративный сплав.

The Future of War
The son of humble Polish Jews, Jean Bloch, who was born in 1836, amassed a large fortune out of Russian railways. At the age of fifty he retired from business, and devoted himself to an exhaustive study of the conditions and possibilities of modern warfare. To this labour he gave eight years, and, in 1898, the fruits of it were published in a work of six volumes, in which he sought to prove that, owing to the immensity of modern armies, the deadliness of modern weapons, and the economic conditions that prevailed in the larger states, a great European war was rapidly becoming a physical impossibility.

Real Christians Don't Attend Christian Churches,Donald Werner,Ebook,USD 2.05,"A Christian is one who follows Christ, accepting the authority of his teachings and commands. Yet, according to the Christian Church doctrine, we don't need to keep Jesus' teachings and commands, we can reject some, or all, of them, and all we need to do “believe”.  The Christian Churches aren't really ‘Christian’, since they deny Christ by denying his teachings. Jesus warned this would happen and told us there would be harsh consequences.  The church has set many of Jesus’ and God’s commands aside, as dictated by their ‘lawless’ church doctrines. I give examples of that in this book. 
Jesus experienced the same problem with the Jews. Instead of church doctrine, they had their 'traditions' or 'oral laws' which were making them lawless.  How did Jesus deal with them?  His parables give that answer, and I explain that in the second half of this book.

The majority of the tales in this volume have been known in the West in some form or other, and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest West and East. Some—as Benfey in Germany, M.

Does The Bible Deny The Divinity Of Jesus?,Michael Jaquish,Hardcover,USD 21.95,"Over one billion followers of  'The God of Abraham' deny that Jesus was divine. They are Jews and Muslims and yes, even some Christians and they consider Jesus a prophet of God, but not God Himself.

To meet the threat they need to understand the perspective of Muslims. 
This book is not designed to convert anyone to Islam; it is simply a presentation of the reasoning Muslims (and other non-Christians) use, often when interpreting the very same passages in the Bible that Christians use to support their belief that Jesus is divine.

Then the day came when a man named Narek felt it was time to seek a home outside of his settlement, and so, since he knew that the holy craft was not too far from where he lived, and that it was still nestled at its appointed place, he decided to see if the ark was worth living in. To his amazement Narek found out that, yes, the sacred cruise ship was a perfect place to move into with his wife, so they could raise children that they planned to have, and to get away from the ungodliness that was growing more and more in the settlement that they had lived in for too long. And Narek and his wife Shushan were glad to know that their new home, the forerunner of a future but mysterious gospel ship, was still located in Armenia, even though the culture to the west of them was vying with Armenia to bring Noah's ark within the borders of a land that would almost forever be hostile to the people of Armenia. But until Narek's spiritual Redeemer would show up to escort him after death, he would delight in having meaningful conversations with his friends from his hometown, while suffering from a dreaded tick disease. And Narek's descendants would also enjoy the fellowship of strangers, and all of that would lead Armenia to have a strong presence in the Holy City.

Writing + Reading = Art,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 30.00,"This book picks up where my book 'Reading + Writing = Illustrations' left off. When I was a boy, I loved to draw, but I don’t think I did so with much carnal ambition (an eager desire for personal advancement). When I graduated high school in 1990, feeling flung out into the world, I saw personal advancement as more important in order to survive - but I speak more of employment at that point in my life, and I did not have a thought about using art in order to make a living. But that was also about the time that I started committing myself more to Christ (but around the age of 9 I asked him into my heart), which moved me to read the Bible more, and to read books about Holy Writ, which was accompanied by books teaching me about history, literature, etc. The more I read, the more I wanted to write, because I wanted to work out the thoughts in my head. And the writing started giving way to illustrations: to a return to my boyhood pleasures. That is what this book is - my attempt to draw the world closer to Messiah (Christ Jesus) through the gift he has given me. This book contains over 100 of my artistic expressions. Some of my drawings have been published in different books, and some have not. The art in this book is just a taste of all of my artistic work. Some of them are in Spanish because of my stay in Mexico, but many are in my native English. And if you find one not in Spanish or English, it is because of my fascination with tongues.

At the time it was written, the novel represented a shift by Scott away from writing novels set in Scotland in the fairly recent past to a more fanciful depiction of England in the Middle Ages. Ivanhoe proved to be one of the best-known and most influential of Scott's novels. Set in 12th-century England, with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial, and divisions between Jews and Christians, Ivanhoe is credited for increased interest in chivalric romance and medievalism. John Henry Newman claimed that Scott ""had first turned men's minds in the direction of the Middle Ages"", while Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin likewise asserted Scott's great influence upon the revival of interest in the medieval period, primarily based upon the publication of the novel Ivanhoe.

Legend has it that when he was stationed there some 20 years earlier, he fell in love with a young woman -- and thus spared the town because of her.
 
There is also a legend that the reason the Men of the Masters are so imperious today is because the town was spared that deep wound.  In a real sense, their forefathers ‘got away’ with one.  Even the title of their tournament is a bit of a give-away: ""The Masters"".  Minorities, woman and Jews are still an issue with these people, and everyone knows it.  Luckily for them, their multicolored ‘Boy Wonder' shoots a great game -- and avoids the 'real' battlefront at every turn.  But not this time.  Not with this opponent.
 
They are all due their comeuppance -- And they are about to get it.

The Problem of Blasphemy: The Fourth Gospel and Early Jewish Understandings,Jerry D.

This study reviews recent research on blasphemy, offers analysis based on hundreds of ancient Jewish texts, and examines seven Jewish traditions pertaining to blasphemy, including cursing God, naming The Name, and sinning with a high hand. A composite portrait of blasphemy is sketched and compared with the theological claims of the Fourth Gospel. Three theological claims of the Fourth Gospel stand out as potentially blasphemous: Jesus is equal with God, Jesus and the Johannine Community constitute the New Temple, and Judean religious leaders are not of God. The perception of blasphemy and the inability to tolerate it explains why some Jewish Christians could not remain in the synagogue.",2011,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Jerry D.

Ivanhoe Illustrated,Sir Walter Scott,Ebook,USD 1.99,"Ivanhoe: A Romance (/ˈaɪvənˌhoʊ/) by Walter Scott is a historical novel published in three volumes, in 1819, as one of the Waverley novels. At the time it was written, the novel represented a shift by Scott away from writing novels set in Scotland in the fairly recent past to a more fanciful depiction of England in the Middle Ages. Ivanhoe proved to be one of the best-known and most influential of Scott's novels. Set in 12th-century England, with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial, and divisions between Jews and Christians, Ivanhoe is credited for increased interest in chivalric romance and medievalism. John Henry Newman claimed that Scott ""had first turned men's minds in the direction of the Middle Ages"", while Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin likewise asserted Scott's great influence upon the revival of interest in the medieval period, primarily based upon the publication of the novel Ivanhoe. Moreover, Ivanhoe much influenced popular perceptions of Richard the Lionheart, King John, and Robin Hood.",2021,English,N/A,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Sir Walter Scott,,,,,EPUB,"['Fiction Novel', 'Historical Novel', 'Romantic Novel', 'War and Military Novel', 'Book by Sir Walter Scott', 'Novel by Sir Walter Scott', 'Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott', 'Ivanhoe', 'Ivanhoe Illustrated', 'Sir Walter Scott']"

The Problem of Blasphemy: The Fourth Gospel and Early Jewish Understandings,Jerry D. Truex,Paperback,USD 21.08,"This doctoral thesis provides evidence that during the later part of the first century, certain Jewish Christians, who produced and propagated the Fourth Gospel, were perceived to be blasphemous and therefore ""cut off"" (kārēt) from the synagogue as reflected in John 9:22, 12:42, and 16:2. This study reviews recent research on blasphemy, offers analysis based on hundreds of ancient Jewish texts, and examines seven Jewish traditions pertaining to blasphemy, including cursing God, naming The Name, and sinning with a high hand. A composite portrait of blasphemy is sketched and compared with the theological claims of the Fourth Gospel. Three theological claims of the Fourth Gospel stand out as potentially blasphemous: Jesus is equal with God, Jesus and the Johannine Community constitute the New Temple, and Judean religious leaders are not of God. The perception of blasphemy and the inability to tolerate it explains why some Jewish Christians could not remain in the synagogue.",2011,English,9780557830701,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Jerry D.

Is it Safe?,Geoff Barnard,Paperback,USD 12.00,"There are two radically differing views about the future of Israel.

Is the modern state of Israel now “safe” or should we expect another holocaust which is often identified with some future “time of Jacob’s trouble” and equated with “Great Tribulation”. 

In this very detailed Bible exposition, Geoff Barnard argues that the “time of Jacob’s trouble” was fulfilled in the Shoah during World War 2 and that out of the ashes of the Holocaust, the nation of Israel has been re-gathered never to be uprooted again (Amos 9:15). Accordingly, Israel now is the only “safe” place for Jewish people and it behoves the Christian community to facilitate Aliyah for them with every resource at their disposal (Isaiah 49:22).

Summary of The Book of Revelation (2),Ramona Brown,Paperback,USD 21.66,"The word “revelation” in the Greek is apocalypses, which means “an uncovering” or “unveiling.” It is therefore a book designed to uncover or unveil, not conceal. Part of the challenge in understanding the book is that it is written in a style not familiar to modern man. It is an example of what is called “apocalyptic literature” which was quite popular from 200 B.C. to 200 A.D. As such, it was a type of literature well known to the Jews and Christians of the first century church.  The early church likely did not have the problem understanding the book as we do today. They were well acquainted with the style of apocalyptic literature. They were living at a time when the symbols of the book were likely familiar to them (similar to how a picture of a donkey fighting an elephant would be understood by us as depicting conflict between the Democratic and Republican parties) “Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near.” (Re 1:3)",2022,English,9781678138240,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Ramona Brown,139,Paperback,Color,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,"['Dispensations', 'Covenants', 'Kingdom', 'Tribulation', 'War in Heaven', 'Final Deliverance of Israel', 'Babylon has Fallen', 'The seven Last Plagues', 'The Dragon and the Woman', 'The Beast from the Earth', 'The Abyss and Lake of Fire']"
For Such a Time as This,Bruce DeBaun,Hardcover,USD 48.00,"For Such a Time as This is perhaps the most comprehensive and persuasive outreach to the Jewish people of our time as it illustrates and verifies the identity of the Mashiach in the Hebrew Holy Scriptures. 

The book was written not only to educate the inquirer but moreover to gift to a Jewish person or family who has not yet accepted their Messiah. It may be a person that GOD has laid upon your heart to lead back to the ""old paths"" and forward to the Cross. It is also, by extension, an outreach to people of all professing faiths who practice a religion without relationship. Their belief is mental acceptance without internalizing that their sins made it necessary for Immanuel to leave His throne, put on flesh, and sacrifice Himself on a cross. Redemption, we know, is only appropriated when one fully grasps His infinite love for them; a love that compelled Him to forfeit His own life for theirs so that they could escape the death and eternal punishment that the law otherwise demands. 

As Jews, we are passionate about our ethnicity and beliefs. We are guarded, and rightfully so, about Gentiles suggesting that we have overlooked or avoided evidence in our Scriptures. Coupled with this is the fear of being drawn into a heretical belief system, shunned by the Jewish community, or losing our identity as Jews. Believing that by becoming a Hebrew Christian we somehow abrogate our Judaism rather than fulfil it has caused many to dismiss evidence and promises. To this end, we embrace tradition, cling to the law, and justify our opinions with natural wisdom. However, because saving faith begins with the intellectual conviction (proof) that the one the Gentiles call Jesus is GOD, it can afterward turn into a decision to surrender to Him as Lord. By faith, the mind trusts, the heart responds, and the will submits. As faith comes by hearing (or reading), it initiates the sequence. Consequently, key to changing the Jewish mind is to provide scriptural evidence and prophetic fulfillment while explaining and expressing the love of GOD. 

The book begins with thought-provoking questions, pauses at prophetic expectations, and dissects the Hebraic. It confronts the fundamental beliefs that divide Judaism and Christianity, such as the ""echad"" (composite) oneness of GOD in trinity and GOD (Immanuel) becoming flesh. It addresses the cause (sin) and its consequence that has kept the Jewish people from recognizing and appropriating the second, ""new"" and ""greater covenant"" promise",2022,English,9780999880616,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Bruce DeBaun,602,Hardcover,Color,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,"['Mystery Babylon', 'End Times', 'Spiritual Deception']"

Believers in the Bible consider the Bible to be the product of divine inspiration - divine with a little 'd', because God is humble.
The books included in the Bible by a good tradition indicate that the tradition views the collection as the true representation of God's words. A number of Bible traditions based on the doctrine of authority have evolved, with overlapping contents from denomination to denomination. The Hebrew Bible overlaps with the Greek Septuagint, even though the Septuagint was written by the Hebrews, and the Hebrew Bible also overlaps with the Christian Old Testament, even though that Testament was written by the Hebrews. The Christian New Testament is a collection of writings by Hebrews who believed in Christ, and they wrote it in a type of Greek called Koine - which means a dialect spoken in Alexandria, Egypt. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what texts should be included as authoritative, primarily about when those texts were written, and those texts are regarded with varying levels of respect.
Attitudes towards the Bible differ among Christian groups. Roman Catholics, 'high church Anglicans', Methodists and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony of the Bible and the traditions of men, while many Protestant churches focus on the idea of the Bible alone. This concept of 'the Bible alone' returned to prominence during a period of history called the Reformation: that is, the church at the beginning believed mostly in the Bible, then many members of God's body drifted more toward the traditions of men, while a large gathering of the worldwide church came to itself again; and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only true source of Christian teaching.
The Bible's importance to humanity has been so great that a journalistic business in the New World was bold enough to say that that book written by Jews so long ago has done more to shape literature, history, entertainment, and culture than any book ever written, that its influence on world history is unparalleled, and its effect shows no signs of diminishing.",2021,English,N/A,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,,,,,EPUB,['Bible']

In this work De Poncins looks into the history of Freemasonry, the condemnations of Freemasonry by the Church, and the efforts of Freemasonry to achieve recognition by the Catholic Church, i.e., a lifting of the condemnations.

The book gives a history of Freemasonry, the various condemnations by numerous Popes and the principles of Freemasonry which violate the Catholic Faith. It also goes into the efforts of Freemasonry to supplant the Catholic Church with a secular faith derived from Masonic principles rather than Christianity; and which, in fact, derive from esoteric Judaism. 

The other books in the trilogy ""Freemasonry and Judaism"", and ""Judaism and the Vatican"" delve deeper into various aspects of the secret war waged against Christ and His Church by Judaism and Freemasonry. “Judaism and the Vatican” looks at the efforts of International Jewry to gain a “Declaration on the Jews” to free themselves from historic charges of deicide and Jewish teachings on the Christian Faith.

Esther,Peter Bloomfield,Paperback,USD 15.00,"The book of Esther is a unique book of the Bible since it does not mention God.  His name is absent and there are no references to miracles or supernatural events.  Nor is there any mention of prayer, or divine law, or great Jewish leaders like Abraham. But Esther is a very valuable book.  
It is the only Biblical record of what happened to the vast majority of Israel who remained in Persia, never returning to Palestine after Cyrus the Mede set them free. Above all, it deals with an extreme danger facing God's covenant people because of an evil man called Haman. 
It was overcome by God's providential rule, otherwise the vast majority of Jews would have been exterminated. There would have been no Nehemiah and no rebuilt Jerusalem. Worse, there would have been no Jesus!
God's absence only makes him more conspicuous. He rules and over-rules so that when humans do whatever they choose, they unwittingly accomplish the designs of God.  He uses even the mundane events of everyday human life to accomplish his covenant purposes. Esther is full of gospel truths. It is a privilege to encourage readers by explaining all of this, and to point out the many practical applications for our daily lives.",2020,English,9781716482885,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Peter Bloomfield,134,Paperback,Black & White,A5 (5.83 x 8.27 in / 148 x 210 mm),,"['Esther', 'Persia', 'Haman', 'Cyrus', 'Purim', 'Mordecai']"

“Summary of the Book of Revelation”,Ramona Brown,Paperback,USD 18.45,"The word “revelation” in the Greek is apocalypses, which means “an uncovering” or “unveiling.” It is therefore a book designed to uncover or unveil, not conceal. Part of the challenge in understanding the book is that it is written in a style not familiar to modern man. It is an example of what is called “apocalyptic literature” which was quite popular from 200 B.C. to 200 A.D. As such, it was a type of literature well known to the Jews and Christians of the first century church.  The early church likely did not have the problem understanding the book as we do today. They were well acquainted with the style of apocalyptic literature.

I have done two years of research and teaching in the Book of Revelation.  It was incredibly challenging but one that I loved and was tremendously blessed to complete.  This will be a summary of my teaching notes with charts and tables and other information that I believe you will be encouraged and motivated to read over and over again.

A Maverick Pilgrim Way,Mary Jane Walker,Paperback,USD 30.99,"A Maverick Pilgrim Way is more than a travel guide. It’s a self-help guide to hiking, to overcome grief.

In her Maverick fashion, Mary Jane walked for years after her mother died. She trekked along the winding ancient roads of Old-World pilgrims, including parts of the Camino de Santiago or St James's Way, the West Highland Way, and climbed Mt Blanc, to name a few. Along the way she came to St Petersburg with its golden palaces, which is her favourite city in Europe.

Pilgrim ways aren’t just for the religious. People of all ages and walks of life come to hike them. She stayed with Russian Jews in Barcelona, so learnt no Spanish. She stayed on a commune just outside of San Sebastian run by a religious group called the Twelve Tribes of Israel, who tried to convert her. She loved Basque food and stayed in an Airbnb where the guy grew marijuana in his lounge.


She was amazed by the vineyards and weird hollow mountains of Cappadocia. In Russia, she got invited to a Pussy Riot punk rock party in St Petersburg and was followed around by internal security spies.

Judaism and the Shadow of Antichrist,Fr. Gaston Ritter,Paperback,USD 13.95,"This work was published in Graz, Austria in 1933 by the Catholic Priest Gaston Ritter. It received the Nihil Obstat and the Imprimatur; nevertheless in our age it would be considered controversial even though the Church has stated that there is nothing therein against the Catholic Faith.
Judaism and the Shades of the Antichrist is both a book about the Jews, and about the Catholic Church and Catholic peoples — and the conflict between them as Judea seeks to bring about their “New World Order”. This book was written for a Catholic Austrian audience. 
Hitler had come to power in Germany on January 30, 1933, but Fr. Ritter does not concern himself with National Socialist, German, or other volkish movements. He is focused upon the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, their seeming coming fulfillment in Europe and violently so in Russia in 1917 — and upon Our Lord’s words and prophecies primarily in Matt. 24, as well as prophecies of various Saints, concerning the End Times.
It is also a call to action for Catholics, and Christians of all stripes, to stand with Christ and against the Antichrist programs seeking to destroy countries and peoples. In many ways it fits our own days, as our culture and religion are under constant attacks using the same tactics as in Austria and Germany in the 1930’s in the current Culture War.",2022,English,9781716353550,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,"By (author): Fr.

Esau,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 40.00,"Esau sought to kill his brother Jacob (Genesis 27:21). Descendants of Esau became prominent among the Romans, Germans, and others.  Esau gave rise to military elites such as the Spartans and to conquering warriors like Alexander the Great. Esau is Great!  There is none like him, for good or bad. He creates civilizations and destroys them. He stalks  through the pages of world history and leaves his imprint everywhere. Esau was blessed that he should benefit from the riches of this earth and be a warrior nation, ""By Your Sword You Shall Live!"" (Genesis 27:20). The Sages opined that in nearly every military exertion, every great battle, anywhere there is fighting to be done,  descendants of Esau will somehow or other be involved, usually at the top, and often on both sides of the trench.  Esau bursts into history as the Heroic Hunter,  the Hero of the Hunt in the Bible (Genesis 25:27).  At times he is not much different from the beasts he chases after. He astounds by the extremes and inconsistencies of his character.  Esau (Edom) was the twin-brother of Jacob (Israel). His destiny was to be often  interlocked with that of the Israelites. Descendants of Esau were to be found both as spread throughout other nations (sometimes as influential cliques),  as well as becoming concrete national identities.  In this sense Esau parallels the Israelites who became scattered like the Jews of Judah or concentrated in specific areas like the Lost Ten Tribes. A good portion of the Israelites are to be found in the Galut [Exile] of Edom,  Judah was amongst Edomites in the physical sense, whereas Joseph (the Ten Tribes) is still a captive in the psychological, social, and spiritual spheres.  Descendants of Edom include the  historical founders of Russia, China, and Japan. Esau and his offshoots from the People of Seir was important in the genesis of ancient Sparta, of early Rome,  of  Venice, and of Germany, and of numerous other nations. Esau was also known as Edom. The Edomites are to be found amongst many other peoples including those of the west.  Input from Edom may well be present in the genealogies of many of us today. The Edomites have their own national characteristics through which they may be recognized.  Esau has an existence parallel to that of the  Israelites from the Ten Tribes. He is similar to them and often neighbors them.  Esau however bears an everlasting implacable instinctive grudge against Judah and Joseph (Amos 1:11).",2015,English,9781678087746,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Yair Davidiy,222,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Esau', 'Edom Rome Sparta', 'japan', 'Germany', 'Venice', 'China', 'Bible', 'Geneaology']"
Reflections on the word of God,Martin Kanengu,Ebook,USD 3.00,"Sabbath and Sunday worship has brought confusion among Christians.
It has drained the energy needed for the church to preach the gospel. A lot of time is spent on name calling and mud slinging. Little is done by way of learning what scripture really says. We, as a church are lacking in devotional prayer to seek guidance. Both the Christian and the non-believer are torn apart. How do we preach to others when we ourselves are either, living a lie or know only half truths ? We need to grow into maturity, Hebrews 5:12. Unless one has time to thoroughly study the word of God as 2 Timothy 2:15 states, it is difficult to proceed with confidence.
Here, we examine the Sabbath and the law, how our early ancestors, from Adam, Noah, Abraham, until God addressed the Jews again in the wilderness, may have regarded and dealt with that particular law. We examine also the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching concerning the Sabbath, and we finally, look at early Church practice, from Pentecost to the times of the Apostles. Some study of the law in contrast to the gospel of grace is done to ascertain what our position in all this situation in relation to law and grace ought to be. The more we come to terms with scripture, the better and bolder we become in proclaiming the good news.",2022,English,9781387804764,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Martin Kanengu,,,,,EPUB,['LAW']

"SUMMARY - Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed The World, 1940-1941 By Ian Kershaw",Shortcut Edition,Paperback,USD 9.98,"* Our summary is short, simple and pragmatic. It allows you to have the essential ideas of a big book in less than 30 minutes.

By reading this summary, you will discover how the decisions of the rulers of the great countries between 1940 and 1941 were decisive in shaping our world. 

You will also discover :

that the decision of the United States to break out of its isolationism was a determining factor in the Allied victory;
that the United Kingdom nearly negotiated with Hitler after the defeat of France in June 1940;
that the process of exterminating the Jews was much more complex than ""Mein Kampf"" announced;
how Stalin was able to remain deaf to the warnings of Nazi Germany's imminent invasion of the USSR.
Between 1940 and 1941, the war was not yet global, but was approaching it dangerously. Ian Kershaw, an eminent historian and professor at the University of Sheffield, specializes in modern and contemporary history. Here he revisits a crucial page in our history. Indeed, the destiny of the world could have been quite different if certain decisions had not been taken. These choices had a strong impact, both on the Allies' and the Axis' side. What are the positions taken during those dark years that shaped the world as you know it?

Edom and Germany,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 40.00,"In many ways Germany is one of the most important nations that has ever existed. It is still important and in the future may become even more so. The Edomites settled in Germany and have influenced its national identity and historical attitude. Edom was the twin brother of Jacob (Israel).The two entities are adversaries to each other. In the End Times it was prophesied that there would be a final war between Edom (Esau) and Joseph the leading Israelite Tribe. Descendants of Edom were to be found in many countries and at some stage were predominant in Germany. Meanwhile, Israel became the Jews of Judah and the Lost Ten Tribes.
Joseph is dominant in the English-speaking nations. This work proves the Israelite origin of certain western peoples. It also shows the Edomite influences in Germany and other countries. At an early stage Esau (Edom) merged with the Hurrian inhabitants of Seir who are ascribed ""Indo-European"" attributes. The Edomites were to be found in several areas throughout the Middle East including Tyre of the Phoenicians and the region of Assyria. Later, different groups of Edomites went all over the world. Many came to Rome and to what is now Germany. These same movements of population also brought the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel to the west. Edomites had assisted the Assyrians in exploiting the labor of Israelite captives and transporting them to areas of Western Europe. Like the Israelites, Edomites were also to be found in areas of Celtic civilization. The Celtic god Esus derives from the Phoenician god Isus whose cult derived from worship of Esau. Esus evolved into the Germanic idol known as Wotan who many considered to personify Germany. Hitler was later equated with Wotan. An additional name in Germans for Wotan was ""Koz"" which was also the name of the national god of the Idumeans (of Edom) in the Middle East. It had been prophesied that Esau would live by his sword and enjoy material benefits from his land. This has been fulfilled by Germany. The Germans display many of the known characteristics of Edom even though most Germans are not necessarily descended from Esau. It is enough that an influential minority come from Esau and that they have helped determine the German national Identity.
In the past there were many Israelites in Germany but this Hebrew element mostly moved out to North America and other areas.",2015,English,9781008993488,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Yair Davidiy,250,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Germany', 'Edom', 'Esau', 'Israel', 'Bible', 'Mythology', 'Talmud', 'Midrash', 'Rome']"

Draughts Dictionary,Govert Westerveld,Hardcover,USD 52.12,"In the atmosphere of wisdom and knowledge the game of Alquerque of Twelve was transformed into the game of Marro de Punta in the fifteenth century. The transformation was completed in 1495 with the introduction of a new powerful lady (domina) and the change of the game of Andarraya, as we observe in the Latin dictionary (1495) of Antonio de Nebrija and the first chess book written by Francesch Vicent and printed in Valencia in 1495 (now lost). The latter book must have contained a diagram of the first beginning position of the draughts game, as we observe in the two manuscripts of this book found in Perugia and Cesena dated around 1500.   With the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and by the conquest of the New World and other countries the Spanish seamen introduced the game of draughts in many countries. We still come across Spanish draughts terms in the Philippines where they still use the word ""eat"" to capture pieces just as they use “comer” in Spain. This is only a small part of our contribution to the history of chess and draughts, but we think that it will be clear to future researchers that the history of chess cannot be forgotten when we speak about the origin of draughts.

The Book of Enoch,Enoch,Paperback,USD 15.00,"The Book of Enoch is an ancient Hebrew apocalyptic religious text, ascribed by tradition to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and giants, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Genesis flood was morally necessary, and prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah.
The older sections (mostly in the Book of the Watchers) of the text are estimated to date from about 300-200 BC, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably to 100 BC. 
Various Aramaic fragments found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as Koine Greek and Latin fragments, are proof that the Book of Enoch was known by Jews and early Christians. This book was also quoted by some 1st  and 2nd century authors as in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. Authors of the New Testament were also familiar with some of the content of the story. A short section of 1 Enoch (1:9) is cited in the New Testament Epistle of Jude, Jude 1:14–15, and is attributed there to ""Enoch the Seventh from Adam""      (1 En 60:8), although this section of 1 Enoch is a midrash on Deuteron 33:2. Several copies of the earlier sections of 1 Enoch were preserved among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The Malefactors,Anne Haw Holt,Paperback,USD 18.66,"My father, Richard Wallace Haw, wrote the basic story of this book a long time ago. His story was obviously a work of love. Written after he had visited Israel, the manuscript sat in a box for years. Its typewriter text faded and the paper curled with age. I loved my father. He was a great man. I went about publishing my novels and working fulltime. Long after his death, I decided to rewrite his story. The language and syntax were so formal, but the story was beautiful. I added my own touches, changing enough to make it flowing and readable. I am immensely proud of The Malefactors, and I believe that my father is too.

Set in Biblical Palestine during the time of Christ. The Malefactors weaves the story of the two thieves, Josias and Lucius, that were crucified with Jesus. The life of Josias, from his birth to the end brings you into the lives of incredible characters and drama. An intricately woven story of crime, adventure, treachery, love and family gives a different perspective of the time when Jesus walked the earth. Historically and biblically accurate, this is a remarkable work of historical fiction.

Demon possession in New Testament times was real, contends the author in the face of rationalistic denials.

The World Jesus Entered,Jon Davies,Ebook,USD 2.99,"The World Jesus Entered traces the roots of what would become the Christian religion during its first two centuries, from the time of Jesus to the second and third generations of Christian believers. Although Jesus was a Jew among Jews who focused his ministry within a Jewish milieu, the Jewish people were themselves part of a wider world that had heavily impacted their culture and society by the time of Jesus; that world would in turn eventually help shape what would become the religions of both Judaism and Christianity. As different parties fought to control Jewish adaptation to a post-Jerusalem-centered mindset, the teachings of Jesus would become subsumed by ideas and practices quite different from those recorded as belonging to the first generation of his followers.

Four discrete chapters focus on differing influences—Jewish, non-Jewish, alt-Jewish, and Gnostic—as an introduction to the societies and cultures the teachings of Jesus entered. The book closes with two chapters showing how such influences impacted both Christian practice and doctrine, in the form of missionary activity and worship and in teachings regarding the afterlife and the very nature of existence proposed by the new Christian sect. As Jewish elites fought to define their culture and as non-Jewish Christians aimed to distinguish themselves from Jewish rebels fighting the Roman Empire and come to an understanding of the man-God Jesus who had been introduced to them, the faith Jesus founded would transform the world as much as it would be transformed by it.",2022,English,9781716249112,Religion & Spirituality,"Creative Commons NonCommercial, ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)",By (author): Jon Davies,,,,,EPUB,"['Judaism', 'Roman Empire', 'Ancient Rome', 'Hellenism', 'afterlife', 'heaven', 'hell', 'missionary work', 'Essenes', 'Pharisess', 'Sadducees', 'Zealots', 'Epicureanism', 'Bible commentary', 'Skepticism', 'Stoicism', 'Plato', 'Platonism', 'Trinity', 'Eucharist', ""Lord's Supper"", 'Synagogue', 'Parting of the Ways', 'Jewish Christianity', 'Jewish Christian', 'Gnostic', 'Gnostics', 'Gnosticism', 'Docetism', 'Cynicism', 'Imperial Cult', 'Paganism', 'Eight Day', 'Idumea', 'Idumeans', 'Herods', 'Herod', 'Galilee', 'Galileans', 'Ancient', 'Samaritans', 'Simon Magus', 'Simon the Magician', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Asceticism', 'Passover', 'house church', 'millennium', 'resurrection']"
The Gospel of St. Matthew,"John Monro Gibson, D.D.",Paperback,USD 15.72,"The New Testament opens appropriately with the four Gospels; for, though in their present form they are all later in date than some of the Epistles, their substance was the basis of all apostolic preaching and writing. As the Pentateuch to the Old Testament, so is the fourfold Evangel to the New. That there should be a manifold presentation of the great facts which lie at the foundation of our faith and hope, was both to be expected and desired. It is manifest that for every reason the Gospel of St. Matthew should occupy the foremost place. ""To the Jew first"" is the natural order, whether we consider the claims of ""the fathers,"" or the necessity of making it clear that the new covenant was closely linked to the old. ""Salvation is of the Jews;"" the Christ of God, though the Saviour of the world, had been in a very special sense ""the Hope of Israel"", and therefore it is appropriate that He should be represented first from the standpoint of that nation. We have, accordingly, in this Gospel, a faithful setting forth of Christ as He presented Himself to the mind and heart of a devout Jew, ""an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile,"" rejoicing to find in Him One who fulfilled ancient prophecy and promise, realized the true ideal of the kingdom of God, and substantiated His claim to be Himself the divine Saviour-King for whom the nation and the world had waited long.",2021,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,No Known Copyright (Public Domain),"By (author): John Monro Gibson, D.D.",459,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Gospel of St. Matthew', 'Bible', 'New Testament']"
The Little Yiddish I Know I Learned From My Grandmother: A Memoir,David Stevens,Ebook,USD 5.17,"David Stevens is a retired professor and attorney. This Memoir is a compilation of his blogs from 2009 to 2021. While not a complete autobiography, it presents a coherent picture of his life and family. As a secular Jew turned atheist, Stevens participates in both the alienation and integration of his people. While he could be said to have participated in the American Dream, rising from the working poor to the upper middle class through education, he also feels elements of an American nightmare, having been affected by alcoholism and domestic abuse. From the title essay: ""My maternal grandmother, Etta Felger Brock, was born in Ukraine in 1905. Over the next ten years her entire family emigrated to America, eventually settling in Milwaukee. Her father, David Felger, went first alone in 1910. Etta's older sisters Fannie and Rose went next in 1913. In 1914 her mother Sylvia Stelnick Felger followed with Etta, her younger sister Katie, and her younger brother Morey (Moishe). They spoke mostly Yiddish at home, although they naturally spoke Ukrainian. They were close enough to Poland that they spoke fluent Polish as well. For political reasons they felt it wise also to speak Russian. In the long run it was a very good thing they left when they did; following World War II there were no Jews left alive in their village (Ustylúh), including the relatives who died because they would not or could not leave. In my imagination it looks like the end of 'Fiddler on the Roof', although I doubt there was any musical accompaniment or any turntable.""",2021,English,9781716174414,Biographies & Memoirs,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): David Stevens,,,,,EPUB,"['Jedwish', 'Memoir', 'Theatre', 'Summer Stock', 'Professor', 'Atorney']"

"We Are In a Pandemic of Lawlessness, and Jesus’ Word Is the Vaccine",Donald Werner,Paperback,USD 8.24,"Like a pandemic virus that has blanketed the whole world, lawlessness has covered the earth like a blanket.  We read in the Book of the Revelation, and ""all the world"" has been deceived and wonders after the Beast. And that Beast is the same serpent Beast that was in the Garden of Eden. What is the Beast's deception?  It's the deception that causes lawlessness.  That's the very same deception that caused Adam and Eve to fall. And it is the very same deception that is taught from Paul's Epistles in our churches today.  And that lawlessness, according to Jesus will result in eternal death.  Yet, there is a vaccine that will prevent that virus and its resulting death. A vaccine of truth that will set people free from that deadly deception.

The Little Yiddish I Know I Learned From My Grandmother: A Memoir,David Stevens,Paperback,USD 14.72,"David Stevens is a retired professor and attorney. This Memoir is a compilation of his blogs from 2009 to 2021. While not a complete autobiography, it presents a coherent picture of his life and family. As a secular Jew turned atheist, Stevens participates in both the alienation and integration of his people. While he could be said to have participated in the American Dream, rising from the working poor to the upper middle class through education, he also feels elements of an American nightmare, having been affected by alcoholism and domestic abuse. From the title essay: ""My maternal grandmother, Etta Felger Brock, was born in Ukraine in 1905. Over the next ten years her entire family emigrated to America, eventually settling in Milwaukee. Her father, David Felger, went first alone in 1910. Etta's older sisters Fannie and Rose went next in 1913. In 1914 her mother Sylvia Stelnick Felger followed with Etta, her younger sister Katie, and her younger brother Morey (Moishe). They spoke mostly Yiddish at home, although they naturally spoke Ukrainian. They were close enough to Poland that they spoke fluent Polish as well. For political reasons they felt it wise also to speak Russian. In the long run it was a very good thing they left when they did; following World War II there were no Jews left alive in their village (Ustylúh), including the relatives who died because they would not or could not leave. In my imagination it looks like the end of 'Fiddler on the Roof', although I doubt there was any musical accompaniment or any turntable.""",2021,English,9781716221255,Biographies & Memoirs,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): David Stevens,166,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['memoir', 'Jewish', 'Theater', 'Attorney', 'American Dream', 'Summer Stock']"

A Thousand Years of Jewish History: “From the Days of Alexander the Great to the Moslem Conquest of Spain”,Maurice H. Harris,Ebook,USD 6.99,"The dual purpose of the revision of this work has been simplification and amplification.
The language has been recast in parts and there have been added sub-titles within each chapter, cross-references and an index. Ideas such as ""Religion as law,"" the Logos of Philo and the development of Messianism have been made as simple as these subjects admit of.
In seeking illustrations to vivify the narrative it is unfortunate that so little is available. Ah! if we had pictures of Hillel, of Akiba the Martyr, of Judah the Saint, of the Jamnia Academy, of the splendor of the Babylonian Exilarch. But this very absence of pictures is in itself a bit of Jewish history.

Living the Good Life: Walking Through Romans Chapters 8 & 12,Warren Hodge,Paperback,USD 15.48,"Back in the first century CE, the famous Christian apostle Paul wrote a topical occasional letter, by no means a systematic theology, to Jesus-following Gentiles and Jews in Rome. Paul was concerned that they would be able to mix together graciously in community – a community that would accede to the teachings of Jesus as interpreted by Paul himself, and, in so doing, bring glory to the name of God. Since Paul's own conversion and call on the road to Damascus, he believed that he had a unique mission to bring grace to the Gentiles and see them unequivocally included in the collective of God's contemporary children. With all of Paul's experience on the journey from place to place – in successful church planting, in responding to practical theological matters, and through difficulties and opposition – he was certainly able to offer clear advice on how to live well in freedom and joy. Let us not mistake Paul's emphasis on making the message of Jesus and his grace available to all without putting roadblocks or hindrances in anyone's way! Chapter 8 of Paul's letter to the Romans covers many important themes pertaining to our faith, while chapter 12 moves such insights into areas of ethics and credible interpersonal and community living. Here we learn how to live a good life! In this commentary, there are 82 daily readings each with a brief principle to take forward.

The Malefactors,A. H. Holt,Hardcover,USD 35.63,"Historical Christian fiction. Story of the two thieves.

An epic tale spanning the lifetime of its characters. Set in Israel during the time of Christ, the story follows the life and times of two thieves. Jerusalem as its background, the story moves from the brutal life of a highwayman to the warmth of family and to the ultimate betrayal and a shattering revelation.

********

My father, Richard Wallace Haw, wrote the basic story of this book a long time ago. His story was obviously a work of love. Written after he had visited Israel, the manuscript sat in a box for years. Its typewriter text faded and the paper curled with age. I loved my father. He was a great man. I went about publishing my novels and working fulltime. Long after his death, I decided to rewrite his story. The language and syntax were so formal, but the story was beautiful. I added my own touches, changing enough to make it flowing and readable. I am immensely proud of The Malefactors, and I believe that my father is too.

Set in Biblical Palestine during the time of Christ. The Malefactors weaves the story of the two thieves, Josias and Lucius, that were crucified with Jesus. The life of Josias, from his birth to the end brings you into the lives of incredible characters and drama. An intricately woven story of crime, adventure, treachery, love and family gives a different perspective of the time when Jesus walked the earth. Historically and biblically accurate, this is a remarkable work of historical fiction.

The connection with is'Ra'El and Amen'Ra is distinguishable once you see, but the masses are oblivious to it. Raymundus Martini invented the name Jehovah in 1278 of our common era, which means Moses and Abraham never said that name.

Smokin' Weed With Jesus,Clifford Beck,Paperback,USD 11.02,"The story begins in a small town near Portland, Maine, where Richard, a bankruptcy attorney, has just taken part in the liquidation of a pornography store. Returning home, he makes the mistake of reaching back for the one thing that soothes the guilt of separating others from their livelihood, and drives headlong into an oncoming vehicle. His body, badly broken, Richard is whisked off to Portland's Maine Medical Center, where he hovers between life and death. As he is about to undergo surgery, he slips into a near-death experience and mysteriously finds himself standing in a familiar looking place, confused about where he is and how he got there.

But some distance away, sits a man, appearing to be dressed as though he had just stepped out of the summer of love. Sitting next to him, Richard surprisingly discovers that this man is none other than Jesus of Nazareth. The ensuing conversation is largely based on Jesus' calm criticism of humankind, religion, and the need for change in order to foster progress.

The conversation comes to a close with Richard receiving both a mission and a gift. He returns to the human world profoundly changed with the memory of his experience intact, and carrying out the Messiah's request, he resumes his life with new purpose and an ability that only he possesses. ‘Smokin' Weed With Jesus’ is an irreverent, humorous criticism given by the King of the Jews and takes aim at the root cause of the world’s problems – our problems. What this book is not is political. The issues that have plagued human history rely on a far more fundamental cause, and it is the author's goal to present not only the cause but the simplicity of coping with them.",2022,English,9781387410774,Humor,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Clifford Beck,120,Paperback,Black & White,Digest (5.5 x 8.5 in / 140 x 216 mm),,"['Christianity', 'God', 'satire', 'Jesus', 'humor', 'irreverent', 'banned', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'Satan', 'Lucifer', 'Islam', 'Conservative', 'war', 'violence']"
Anti-Judaism in the Old Testament 《旧约圣经》中的“反犹主义”,Xuanjun Xie,Hardcover,USD 39.26,"通过对《旧约圣经》的全面阅读不难发现：对犹太人的批判并非《新约圣经》开始的，而是贯穿了《旧约圣经》的始终。本书从《旧约圣经》各个部分摘录了310个段落，来证明“反犹主义”确为《旧约圣经》的主题之一。其中有些是明显的，有些并非显明，但联系上下文思索一下就不难发现：上帝对选民的要求非常严厉，而且处罚起来毫不留情。可悲的是，作为选民的犹太人先祖，常常辜负了上帝委托。
Synopsis:
An all-round reading of the Old Testament would make it clear that anti-Judaism does not begin with the New Testament, but rather prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The present book by Mr Xie Xuanjun has taken 310 paragraphs from the Old Testament-- all going to show that anti-Judaism is really one of the theses of the Old Testament. Anti-Judaism in evident in some of the paragraphs, while less so in others, but what could be inferred from the context is that God is strict to the followers and is far from lenient in meting out punishments. What is sad is that the forefathers of Jews, as followers of God, have often failed to live up to the authority of God.",2016,Chinese,9781365047190,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Xuanjun Xie,414,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Judaism', 'Testament', 'Jiu Yue ', 'Sheng Jing ']"
THE RUSSIAN CHURCH AND THE REVOLUTION,Vladimir Moss,Paperback,USD 50.28,"Archimandrite Cyril (Zaitsev) of Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville, once said that of all the evils and sorrows produced by the Russian revolution, the most terrible and shameful was the transformation of the official Russian Orthodox Church into an obedient tool of World Communism, the “Soviet church” of the Soviet state. This book describes how this happened. 

“The Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate” is the largest Christian Church in the world with the exception of the Vatican. As negotiations intensify to unite the two huge churches, it would be useful to investigate the origins of the Moscow Patriarchate. Most people think it is just the continuation, into the Soviet and post-Soviet periods, of the pre-revolutionary Russian Orthodox Church. But, as this book will attempt to demonstrate, that is not the case. The present-day Moscow Patriarchate was in fact created by Stalin as a crucial element in his antireligious campaign, the second major attempt to divide the Church and create a “fake” church controlled by the communists in order to deceive the faithful into accepting a form of pseudo-Christianity loyal to Communism and the New World Order instead of the real thing.

Something similar had been attempted during the French Revolution, when the Church was divided into those who swore to uphold a pro-revolutionary Civil Constitution of the Clergy and those who rejected it. On July 12, 1790 a Civil Constitution for the Clergy was passed, rationalizing the Church’s organization, putting all the clergy on the State’s pay-roll. The 135 bishops were cut down to 85, one for each département, and provided one curé for every 6,000 inhabitants. Bishops were henceforth to be elected (by an electorate including non-believers, Protestants and Jews) without reference to Rome.",2021,English,N/A,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Vladimir Moss,593,Paperback,Black & White,A4 (8.27 x 11.69 in / 210 x 297 mm),,"['Russia', 'revolution', 'communism', 'sergianism', 'ecumenism', 'heresy', 'Orthodoxy', 'Christianity']"

The Malefactors,A. H. Holt,Hardcover,USD 44.98,"Historical Christian fiction. Story of the two thieves.

An epic tale spanning the lifetime of its characters. Set in Israel during the time of Christ, the story follows the life and times of two thieves. Jerusalem as its background, the story moves from the brutal life of a highwayman to the warmth of family and to the ultimate betrayal and a shattering revelation.

********

My father, Richard Wallace Haw, wrote the basic story of this book a long time ago. His story was obviously a work of love. Written after he had visited Israel, the manuscript sat in a box for years. Its typewriter text faded and the paper curled with age. I loved my father. He was a great man. I went about publishing my novels and working fulltime. Long after his death, I decided to rewrite his story. The language and syntax were so formal, but the story was beautiful. I added my own touches, changing enough to make it flowing and readable. I am immensely proud of The Malefactors, and I believe that my father is too.

Set in Biblical Palestine during the time of Christ. The Malefactors weaves the story of the two thieves, Josias and Lucius, that were crucified with Jesus. The life of Josias, from his birth to the end brings you into the lives of incredible characters and drama. An intricately woven story of crime, adventure, treachery, love and family gives a different perspective of the time when Jesus walked the earth. Historically and biblically accurate, this is a remarkable work of historical fiction.

¶
God judges not only individuals, but nations and their leaders. The book of Genesis reveals how God judged the world in the days of Noah, which resulted in the Great Deluge. He would later judge the nation that built the tower of Babel, destroying it and scattering its people across the ancient world. In the time of Moses, God destroyed the nation of Egypt and the dynasty of the ruling Pharaoh. In the generations after Solomon, He judged the ten northern tribes of Israel and sent the nation of Assyria to destroy it and take its people into captivity. Then He judged the nation of Judah, and had Nebuchadnezzar destroy Solomon's Temple. The surviving Jews were held captive in Babylon for 70 years. God later judged the leaders of the empire of Babylon and found them ""lacking"", so He handed the empire over to the Medes and Persians. Later, the Greeks would conquer them. The Roman empire arose three centuries later. In 70 AD, God destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Temple. The nation of Judea was utterly destroyed by Rome and its emperors.
¶
God's prophets foretold each and every one of those judgments. They also foretold of God's coming judgment on all the nations of the world. Titus Flavius Josephus witnessed the final seven year tribulation of the nation of Judea. The Bible refers to this time as ""a little season"". At the end of this present age, a similar fate awaits every nation on Earth whose people have rejected their Creator, the Author of our salvation.",2021,English,9781678098186,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Kerry L.

Being Human After 1492,Richard Pithouse,Paperback,USD 12.80,"The pamphlet begins with two letters written by Paul the Apostle in which Christianity first acquires a universal address. The new religion came to exclude people who were not Christians from the count of the human. This became explicit around a thousand years later when Pope Urban II authorised the First Crusade. 

In 1492 planetary history was split in to two. Muhammad XII of Granada conceded defeat to Isabella and Ferdinand, the Catholic monarchs of Portugal and Spain, who went on to expel the Jews from the territory under their control. Europe became a Christian project. In the same year Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean and Europe also became an imperial project with a planetary reach. 

The origins of the racial ideology can be seen in this period, in which ideas about religion came to be entangled with fantastical ideas about the imagined purity of blood. But it was in the English colony of Virginia in the seventeenth century that the legitimation for the exclusion from the count of the human began to move from claims made in the name of religion to claims made in the name of science. This is the point at which modern racism, rooted in the appearance of the body, began to cast its malignant shadow across the planet. 

The author argues that the struggle to put an end to the epoch of world history that opened in 1492 will require new ideas, and new practices. It follows the Caribbean tradition that runs from Aimé Césaire to Frantz Fanon and Sylvia Wynter in affirming the need for a counter-humanism, a radical humanism, a humanism that, in Césaire’s famous phrases, is “made to the measure of the world”. There is a need for a shift in the ground of reason towards the lived experience and struggles of people rendered, in Wynter’s phrase, as ‘pariahs outside of the new order’.

Slavery In History,Adam Gurowski,Paperback,USD 13.62,"The laws of history are as absolute as the laws of nature or the laws of hygiene. As an individual cannot with impunity violate hygienic law—as nature always avenges every departure from her eternal order: so nations and communities cannot safely deviate from the laws of history, still less violate them with impunity. History positively demonstrates that slavery is not one of the natural laws of the human race, any more than disorders and monstrosities are normal conditions of the human body. It is unnecessary to dwell on the generally known fact of the captivity and enslavement of the Jews, or to detail the researches concerning the Hycksos—first slaves, then masters and rulers, and finally again overpowered and reduced to captivity. But beside these Shemites, Hebrews—be they Hycksos or not—all other races and nations were at some time or other captives and slaves in Egypt. The Pharaohs warred with Asiatics, and especially with what is now called Caucasian races; and the monuments show that red, white, and yellow slaves taken in war were far more numerous than the blacks. In the history of the Phœnicians, and therefore, in the earliest authentic epoch, a great historical and social law manifests itself in full action. This activity it retains through all the subsequent social and political catastrophes in the life of nations and empires, down even to Hayti with her immortal Toussaint. Slavery generates bloody struggles. Many of these have resulted in the slaves violently regaining their liberty, while others have destroyed the whole state—swallowing up the slaveholders in their own blood, or burying them under the ruins of their own social edifice. This whole question of Slavery must be forced back to where it was left by the immortal expounders of Southern instinct and intuition on slavery, those noble patriots—Henry, Laurens, Washington, Jefferson, Mason, Randolph, and a host of other great names—now forsworn by their political descendants.

Antichrist,Dan Griffey,Paperback,USD 25.85,"The day of rejoicing turns into the night of sorrow as even darker clouds descend upon the three kingdoms as they rush to their places of safety as the Antichrist reveals himself in the Holy of Holies. His demonic UFO air force aids him in his takeover of the Holy Land. Marching with a hive mind and dark souls comes his army of those who have already taken the mark of the Beast.

Pressed hard, the armies of the three kingdoms push back the darkness allowing the last of the saints into the strongholds as two of the greatest men of God in all history appear on the battlefront calling down plagues of biblical proportions upon the dark forces.

Great deception fills the earth as China holds onto its conquered territories in the Pacific, and what’s left of the Russian army and people who have refused the mark of the Beast in the midst of World War 4 fortify Siberia.
After two years of the greatest, darkest kingdom the world has ever known comes midnight. The Groom comes in the middle of the night and takes His Bride. He carries her home in His arms as the world wakes the next morning to an evil twilight. It rushes in to fill not only the void the saints leave after they depart, but also the vacuum the Holy Spirit causes with its withdrawal. It is now the feared Great and Terrible Day of the Lord, which falls like a hammer on the godless nations.

Up from the deep come the dreaded Kaiju monsters formed from fallen angels’ genetic experiments taken place before Noah’s boat got wet, now hacked by Heaven to bring judgment upon the nations.  In the heavens, Nibiru (Planet X) brings with it the rest of the hailstones spoken of by Job, grounding UFOs and making the armies of Nephilim useless.

The Chinese army who refused to take the mark of the Beast finally sense this opportunity to march to the Holy Land in revolt against the Antichrist’s kingdom of darkness.

Expounding the Scriptures: Isaiah & Revelation,Kelly Gneiting,Paperback,USD 13.62,"The scriptures, and these two book specifically, largely prophecy of the dealings of the house of Joseph, who are the remnant of the house of Israel–the majority of which are Native Americans, but also includes the Gentiles who will be numbered with (or adopted into) the seed of Nephi.  To apply these two books to either unconverted Gentiles or Jews (of the tribe of Judah), as the vast majority of teachers and ministers do, is a grave mistake.  Judah will be among the last tribes to convert to Christ in the last days. 
 
The Book of the Remnant is holy scripture, although it is a record written by an Indian Prophet living today, and hence ignored by mainstream Christians, as repeats over and over again pertaining to scripture written during the lifetime of the prophets who write them.  And yet this record is true.  In this record, it states, pertaining to the book of Revelation, ""those who would have the privilege of understanding the writings of John [] must have their eyes single to the glory of God as it pertains to Nephi’s seed.""

Nephi's seed is the remnant within the remnant.  When father Israel gave his blessing to his son Joseph, he pronounced, ""upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren; [that] his beauty shall be like his firstborn bullock, and his horns as the horns of an unicorn: with them he shall smite the people together, even the ends of the world: these are also the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh."" –see Deut 33

Ephraim squandered his birthright, much like Esau did to Jacob.  Manasseh is the seed of Nephi, and pertain to a tenth of Joseph's seed.  These only, with the Gentiles who repent, will understand these two books as written by the prophet-author's intent.  All others will continue to be lost.

The Moorish Nation Builders of America and its membership are, first and foremost, blood inheritors and adherents of pure Monotheism and its derivative cultures (also known as the “Hermetic Principles and Abrahamic Religions”), through the ancient teachings of Noah a.s.,
Enoch a.s. and the pure tenants of the Sunnah of Ibrahim Khalillulah a.s., (Abraham the Friend
of God a.s., founder of the Abrahamic Monotheistic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Al-Islam
as reestablished by the Prophet Muhammad a.s.). Moorish Americans hold that we are one
people whose ancestors traversed the earth, establishing ancient spiritual orders through divine
messengers and building enlightened communities later to be known as Kemetics, Buddhist,
Hindus, Jews, Israelites, Christians, Muslims, and others. The pure tentants of these knowledge
systems were reestablished by divine order through the Prophet Muhammad a.s. in 600 AD. The
purposeful failure to draw distinctions between these knowledge-systems, and using all ancestral
and modern knowledge collectively for the perfection of man is known as “MOORISH
SCIENCE''. We view all knowledge systems and truths as one with the Whole (Al-Wahid), that
is Allah. We do not separate scholarship from worship as they are one in the same. With that
said, “Moorish Science'' is an Islamic, monotheistic understanding that is holistic in its
application as a lifestyle, culture, and socio-political and socio-economic worldview.
Noble Drew Ali, A Moorish American Leader — descendant of the Ancient Moabites — was
born in the North Carolina Territory, Northwest Africa (America), in the year 1886 A.D., (1306
Moorish Calendar). He was born of the Cherokee tribe of the Moorish Empire, and was named
Timothy Drew. At a very young age a young Mr. Drew was inspired to learn more about the
scattered bits and pieces of knowledge, heritage and culture of his Ancient Moorish peoples. He
began to travel through his ancestral homeland (Amexem) seeking knowledge of his ancestry,

Who is True Israel?,Donald Werner,Paperback,USD 7.32,"God created all people.   Within the total of humanity God has a group of people that He considers His own, His chosen people.  These chosen few were given a name that defines who they are, and what makes them separate from all other people.  That name of course is ‘Israel’.  “Israel” means ‘one who struggles with God’.  It’s one who wrestles with God’s Divine authority, i.e., His commands, laws and promises.  And after the internal struggle is over, they surrender their own wills to submit to YHVH’s Divine will.

The problem is, we are all born with a selfish nature, that is, we are by nature self-centered, self-absorbed and we elevate self to top priority in our lives and we desire to be self-ruled and put self first– we don’t want anyone telling us what to do.  We by nature don’t want to submit to anyone else’s authority.  However, YHVH God calls on us to humble ourselves and submit to His Divine authority.  And our internal struggle must happen in order to do that, we must crucify ‘self’, i.e., self-love, selfishness, self-centeredness, etc.  And that is what Jesus called us to do, in order to be one of God’s chosen people; Matthew 16:24, “Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.”  And Luke adds the word ‘Daily’. And when we are able to do that we are true children of Abraham and partake in a covenant relationship with YHVH God, by fulfilling the stipulations of the Covenant, becoming Israel and receiving the promise of eternal life.

In this book I will examine the Scriptures to see what it alone says about who is the true Israel.  I will draw on many of scriptures from the New and Old Testaments which tell us how we can be true Israel.  By the time you are done with this book, the answer you are seeking will be obvious.",2017,English,9781387181308,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Donald Werner,36,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Israel', 'New Covenant', 'Spiritual Israel', 'Who is Israel', 'Torah', 'Torah keeping', 'law', 'commandments', 'salvation', 'true israel', 'the lost', 'Jesus', 'YHVH', 'Yahoveh', 'authority', 'divine authority', 'submit', 'submission', 'grace', 'saving grace', 'Exodus', 'Revelation', 'Zechariah', 'apocolyptic', 'judgment', ""Jesus' words"", 'Abram', 'Abraham', 'Jacob', 'chosen people', 'the elect', 'two folds', 'Gentiles graphed in', 'Jews', 'Judaism']"

The apostles believed Jesus would return during their time, thus the prophecies of Jerusalem’s destruction and Jesus’ return run together in the four Gospels. The conjoining of those two prophecies has led modern prophecy writers and commentators to forecast the destruction of Jerusalem again before Jesus returns, but that view is incorrect. Those prophecies of horror were fulfilled by 70 A.D., and the Jews have returned to their homeland - never to be destroyed again:

“Shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.” (Luke 2:24)

When Jerusalem became a state in 1948, that signaled the end of the Time of the Gentiles; Jerusalem will no longer be trodden down. The same is true for America; she will not be destroyed either. The only remaining prophecies of terror are those described in John’s Revelation involving the Antichrist and the mark of the beast, etc. but that outcome is not set in stone, and the prophecy of deception in the temple by the Antichrist/Man of Sin has already been fulfilled. Prophecy writers should use Paul’s definition of the temple to interpret his prophecy in 2 Thessalonians 2:4. The “temple” is our body, or the body of Believers:

“Know ye not that YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE of the Holy Ghost?” (1 Corinthians 6:19)

We have a period of grace which began with one eclipse (August 21, 2017) and goes to the next (April 8, 2024). If we do not repent, the wrath of God will be poured out with the horrors described in the Revelation of John, but the righteous will be removed.

If you do not believe in:

        -The removal of the wicked

        -The arrival of the armies of God

        -The coming of the New Jerusalem

        -God’s glory to be poured out (not more of the Holy Ghost)

CHRISTIANITY  AND   WORLD RELIGIONS,Dr. LI JIN WEI,Paperback,USD 22.00,"Exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism are the three traditional conceptions of Christianity's relationship with other religions. The exclusive paradigm claims that there is no redemption outside of Christianity; Christian fundamentalists often adopt this approach. Religion God's scholars despise idolatry. Exclusivism bases much of its reasoning on Old Testament writings that condemn the worship of other gods, claiming that the purpose of ""God-breathed Old Testament Scripture"" is to guide the Christian church.
  The inclusive concept of Christianity's connection with other faiths asserts that God may save adherents of other faiths. The model is particularly associated with the fact that Christ died for all, and the Holy Spirit offers all possibility of being associated in a way known to God, and God's salvation includes salvation for both Jews and those who acknowledge the Creator, the first of whom are Muslims, who profess Abraham's faith. It goes on to declare that because God desires that all men be saved, salvation will be granted to those who have never heard of the Christian faith but follow their conscience anyhow. On the Protestant side, a similar argument is made for the uniqueness of salvation in Christ, arguing that Christians cannot call themselves evangelicals while limiting salvation to a select few.
  People of different faiths could receive God's revelation in addition to salvation, and whenever people have a real religious experience, that experience could be Jesus showing himself. Although Jesus is the fullest expression of divine revelation, this does not rule out the possibility that God can also reveal himself through prophets and sages of other faiths. As a result, other faiths' Scriptures might incorporate God's Word, and the Holy Spirit can work in other faiths and cultures. 
The third model is pluralism, which differs from exclusivist and inclusivist models in that it places God at the center rather than Christ. God is better known as the Eternal One and is later referred to as the Real. All religious faiths, whether theistic or non-theistic, revolve around this Eternal One or Real.

Passing to his more immediate subject, he proves that the Holy Spirit is above the whole Creation and is truly God, alleging as a special argument that the sin against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, here or hereafter. He shows how the Holy Spirit is in Scripture called the Spirit of God; that He spoke by the prophets and apostles; that He sanctifies men, and is typified by the mystical ointment spoken of in Scripture. Next, St. Ambrose treats of His oneness with the other two Persons of the Holy Trinity, and shows that His mission in no way detracts from this oneness, but that there is in all the Divine Persons a perfect unity of peace, love, and other virtues.

The second section commences with a treatment of the history of Samson in the same way as that of Gideon in Book I. Samson always succeeded so long as the Holy Spirit was with him, but fell into misfortune so soon as he was forsaken. It is shown that the power of the Holy Spirit is the same as that of the Father and the Son, and that there is an agreement in design and working, and in vivifying man. He is Creator and therefore to be worshipped, and He worked with the Father and the Son in founding the Church, and in conclusion is proved the unity of operation in the Three Persons.

The third section continues the same argument, showing that the mission of prophets and apostles, and even of the Son Himself, is to be referred to the Spirit, yet without any subjection on the part of the Son, seeing that the Spirit also receives His mission from the Father and the Son. The Godhead of the Holy Spirit is next taken up and proved, when occasion is taken also to show that there are not three Gods or three Lords, for the Three Divine Persons are one in holiness and nature; and the work is concluded with a summary of some of the principal arguments.",2020,English,9781716957710,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,"Translated by: St George Monastery, Translated by: Anna Skoubourdis, Translated by: Monaxi Agapi, Translated by: St George Monastery, Translated by: Anna Skoubourdis, Translated by: Monaxi Agapi",140,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['philokalia', 'orthodox church', 'orthodox prayer', 'orthodox study bible', 'jesus', 'christian', 'catholic', 'catholic prayer']"
Christianity and Chinese Nationalism 基督教与中国民族主义,Xuanjun Xie,Hardcover,USD 69.00,"作者谢选骏在本书中收集了六十篇各种观点的文章，并加以评注，意在说明一个思想焦点：基督教在华传播的最大障碍，是遇到了“民族主义的抵抗”，而如何处理这一障碍，攸关基督教在中国乃至在世界的命运。这一点也可以从佛教和共产主义的在华传播，得到比较证明。佛教和共产主义在中国也曾面对过民族主义的质疑和抗拒，但是，佛教和共产主义现今却在对抗基督教在华传播的过程中，扮演了民族主义的卫兵角色。其实这个问题不是中国特有的，作者发现，基督教比较成功的那些社会，都是比较好地处理了基督教与自身的民族主义之间关系的社会。因为对所有民族来说，基督教都可以说是外来的：在世界三大宗教里，基督教特别遭到犹太人的敌视，还不像佛教受到印度人的宽容、伊斯兰教得到阿拉伯人的服从。
Synopsis:
Christianity is, in some way, a religion foreign to all nations. Among the three major religions of the world, Christianity has been looked at with hostility by the Jews, unlike Buddhism that has been treated with tolerance by the Indians, and unlike Islam, too,  that has been followed by the Arab nations. By anthologizing and commenting on the 60 articles with various points of views, the author Xie Xuanjun aims at illustrating the point that nationalism is the biggest obstacle to the spread of Christianity in China, and the removal of nationalism is key to the destiny of Christianity in China and in the whole world.",2016,Chinese,9781365098987,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Xuanjun Xie,740,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Ji Du Jiao ', 'Zhong Guo ', 'Min Zu ', 'Christianity', 'Chinese', 'Nationalism']"

How Does the Christian Church Dishonor God and Jesus?,Donald Werner,Paperback,USD 8.32,"The Bible tells us to honor our mothers and our fathers.  The greatest honor we can give our parents, or God, is to respect them by obeying their instructions, that is, submitting to their authority.  But contrary to that, the greatest dishonor we can give to our parents, or God, is to spurn their authority so that we reject and disobey their instructions.  When we reject and ignore God’s commands, God calls that ‘bring reproach on His name’ and ‘despising His word’ (Numbers 15:30).  By following Paul’s writings, the church believes the ‘law is dead’, ‘done away with’, and that salvation is granted to those who spurn God's authority and will not keep His law.  Jesus didn’t see it that way, he clearly and often called on us to keep God’s law and repent when we failed – otherwise we would not be fit from God's Kingdom. The church rejects Jesus’ command to keep God’s law, and embraces Paul’s lawless theology.  And the net result is that the Christian Church has produced people who ‘practice lawlessness’, ‘bring reproach on God’s name’ and ‘despise God’s word’ and according to Jesus, those who practice lawlessness will be cast into a lake of fire.

Teresa’s War,Margaret J. Carr,Ebook,USD 2.99,"It was 1942. A small peasant farm, in the mountainous region of Nazi 
occupied Austria. On it lived a man, his wife and two daughters seven and five 
years old. Their life was relatively unaffected by the war, even if a Nazi garrison 
was close to the tiny village in the Tyrol. The father was unable to work because of 
a bad chest and recurring bouts of severe seizures so mother took in sewing and 
mending from the women of the village to subsidize their meager existence.
The mayor, who was also the chief of police of the village and a 
collaborator, was the family’s landlord and used his position to continually harass 
and make sexual overtures at the mother when the father was away. She was able
to refuse his unwanted advances.
One night a terrified family of Hungarian Jews, desperate to escape to 
Switzerland, hid in a barn on the property and suddenly the family was in great 
danger. It was mid-winter and bringing the four inside the farm house to shelter in 
the roof space, only her mother and Teresa knew the dangerous secret. They stayed 
in the roof space for weeks until the mother decided it was safe to move them, but 
that was also the night, knowing father was drinking with his friends in the local 
wine lodge, that the mayor came calling. It was the mother who let him rape her 
while her daughter took the refugees to safety and across the border.
Months later, first discovering she was now pregnant and knowing the child 
couldn’t be her husband’s she miscarried on the very day she’d agreed to take 
another group of refugees. Once again it was Teresa who led them to safety only 
just escaping discovery by soldiers, who were ready to shoot everything that 
moved in the dense pine forest bordering the farm.
The Germans, finding out about the escapes and the family’s possible 
involvement arrested her father and after days of interrogation and torture, finding 
out nothing from the innocent, sick man, released him. He never recovered from 
the ordeal and died shortly after. Teresa’s mother, a devout Catholic, weak with 
grief and worry died on her knees in the small church soon after the war ended. 
The two sisters eventually moved abroad to start a new life.

Gog Magog,zubair khalil,Ebook,USD 5.17,"GOG MAGOG
This is a research work. In this book I have explained that who are Gog Magog where they are and how are they appear? In this book I have explained their location and their appearance. I have also explained about Dhul Qarnayn and where is the wall built by him is located. To explain this topic l has taken help from the Holy Quran, Hadith (Saying of Hazrat Muhammad SAW), Bible and some other sources. I have used Picture and maps to explain their appearance and location.
In Judaism, Christianity and Islam, there is a mention of a mysterious race of human beings called “Gog and Magog” (Yajuj and Majuj in Arabic). Several predictions have been made about which group of people this can be, however till date our understanding is far from being complete. I was told about the stories of Gog and Magog during my childhood by my mother and some other people. Since then, I have always been curious about their existence, their powers and why they have been specifically called out in. 
According to Holy Quran and Hadith (Sayings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) these incidents must occur before dooms day or near the doomsday. Like Muslims, Jews and Christians are too waiting for their expected attack on civilized nations before Qayamat (Doomsday) it is mentioned about their attack in old and New Testament in Bible. According to Holy Quran and Sayings of prophet Muhammad (PBUH) their Invasion before Qayyamat (Doomsday) on the Nations is one of the signs of Qayamat (Doomsday). In The Holy Quran and Hadith a lot is written about Gog and Magog especially in Hadith (sayings of prophet). It is strange that their location, their structure and shapes are also mentioned in Hadith (Prophet’s saying) although he had never read any book or he had never gone to any institution to get education.

Elohim,Kerry L. Barger,Hardcover,USD 19.99,"You may have wondered who first penned the biblical Genesis account and where its familiar stories originated. Many believe it was written by Moses. Others consider it merely a collection of older fables that were restructured and compiled after the Jews returned from exile in Babylon. Recently, scholars have uncovered another explanation that defies belief!
 ¶
The first intelligent life on Earth may have arrived here from another world, according to a number of recently discovered 5,000 year-old cuneiform texts. This fantastic tale may have actually been documented by an individual who claimed to be one of many ancient explorers who traveled to Earth from another planet. In the oldest Mesopotamian myths, he is credited with having made the first humans and guiding the development of Earth's first civilization.
 ¶
Written in his own words, the author of this book's ancient autobiographical account may have been the creator of mankind. His influence can be found in every major religion on our planet.
 ¶
The following is from an editorial review by Peter M. Fitzpatrick:
 ¶
""I have sought to find additional truths underlying biblical texts by researching historical and archeological data.""
 ¶
Sumerian literature, lately rediscovered through archeological relics over 5,000 years old, is composed of cuneiform letters that are difficult to translate. As a result, widely varying interpretations of its meaning have fueled controversial theories, the most famous perhaps being those of Zechariah Sitchin. His ideas about ancient astronauts from a planet beyond Neptune that mine gold on Earth by genetically engineering Homo erectus with their own DNA to produce Homo Sapiens, are echoed here. Kerry frames his narrative in the recollections of the Biblical Nehemiah as he is returning to Israel after the Babylonian Captivity. His memory of the Sumerian shards he was made to translate lead to a ""flashback"" style of recasting the Book of Genesis retold as if ""Elohim"" was in fact an ancient astronaut. The planet of origin is updated to the recently mapped Eris, 27 [percent] more massive than Pluto. All ""tree-of life"" references are interpreted as being symbolic of DNA strands.

A HISTORY OF THE FALL OF ROCOR,Vladimir Moss,Paperback,USD 12.66,"The return of the Russian Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) to Russia in 1990 after almost seventy years’ exile was undoubtedly one of the most significant events in Church history, comparable to the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after the seventy-year exile in Babylon. And yet this momentous step was taken almost casually, without sufficient forethought or a clearly defined strategy. Hence difficult problems arose, problems that had their roots deep in ROCOR’s past history. These problems can be divided into three categories: (A) ROCOR in relation to her own flock at home and abroad, (B) ROCOR in relation to the Catacomb Church, and (C) ROCOR in relation to the Moscow Patriarchate (MP) and the post-Soviet Russian State. A. ROCOR in relation to herself. The problem here is easily stated: how could the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad continue to call herself the Church Abroad if she now had parishes inside Russia? After all, her Founding Statute or Polozhenie stated that ROCOR was an autonomous part of the Autocephalous Russian Church, that part which existed (i) outside the bounds of  Russia  on  the  basis  of  Ukaz  №  362  of  November  7/20,  1920  of  Patriarch Tikhon and the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, and (ii) temporarily until the fall of communism in Russia. 1 With the fall of communism and the creation of ROCOR parishes inside Russia in 1990-91, it would seem that these limitations in space and time no longer applied, and that ROCOR had ceased to exist as a temporary Church body existing outside Russia in accordance with her own definition of herself in thePolozhenie . The solution to this problem would appear to have been obvious: change the Polozhenie ! And this was in fact the solution put forward by ROCOR’s leading canonist, Bishop Gregory (Grabbe). However, the ROCOR episcopate declined that suggestion, and thePolozhenie remained unchanged. Why? Although we have no directevidence on which to base an answer to this question, the following would appear to be a reasonable conclusion from the events as they unfolded in the early 1990s. A change in the Polozhenie that removed the spatial and temporal limitations of ROCOR’s self-definition would have had the consequence of forcing ROCOR to define herself as the one true Russian Orthodox Church, and therefore to remove the centre of her Church administration from America to Russia and enter into a life-and-death struggle with the MP for the minds and hearts of the Russian people.",2021,English,N/A,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Vladimir Moss,91,Paperback,Black & White,A4 (8.27 x 11.69 in / 210 x 297 mm),,"['ROCOR', 'Moscow Patriarchate']"

The Coming WORLD RELIGION and the MYSTERY BABYLON - Paperback by Lambert EZE Okafor,Lambert Eze Okafor,Paperback,USD 15.99,"THE DAY IS COMING FAST!...
Dear Reader, are you a Catholic, Anglican, Pentecostal or any other? Or, may be you are not even a Christian? Well, we are asking such questions for the last time because a time is coming, and it is near indeed, when it will no longer be possible to ask what religion or religious sect one belongs to. Why? Because all humanity would have embraced One World Religion! At that time everybody on earth will belong, by force or by choice, to one global satanic cult called World Religion and those who try to resist it would be considered enemies of humanity and would be severely dealt with.

We are seeing individual worship places, such as churches and mosques, for the last time. In the near future, under the United Religious System, there would be only one worship place for each community, perhaps called Global Worship Centre. We might then have something like Global Worship Centre, Aba, Onitsha, Ibadan, Ikoyi-Lagos, and so on. It will then become illegal for any group to have a separate place of worship! All faiths - Christians, Moslems, Witches, Jews, Hindus and others would be made to 'worship' together at the designated places. This would be happening world wide and so there would be no hiding place.

Yes, One-World Religion is coming fast, together with One-World Government. In this global satanic worship system, a 'Christian' Religious Leader is likely to be at the head, for John saw him appearing as a 'Lamb'(Revelationl3:11), in imitation of Christ, the Lamb of God. This leader would be accepted and respected world wide, not only as a religious leader, but also as a political and an economic leader - three roles in one! That man is coming!

Those who have received the Lord Jesus Christ by then would be in trouble, for one-world religion would essentially be anti-Christ in operation. True believers would be made to worship God in hiding. And, as the persecution increases, one by one, the love of many would begin to wax cold (Matthew 24:12). Only a few sincere Christians would endure it all - to the very end! (Matthew 24:13).

On the other hand, those who have not received Christ by then would be considered good people and they would be given all kinds of good things of THIS life by the government and its agencies. But they may NEVER have the chance to know the Lord Jesus Christ again!

Our current “culture wars” and new assertions of privileged religious beliefs provide the context for this question. When Christians attend church on Sunday, do they receive the authentic teachings of Jesus in their pastor’s message?  Or are they contenting themselves with something else?

Bible-reading Christians know something about the times in which Jesus lived, and they are familiar with the times in which we live now.  But most know very little about how the Christian church grew and developed its beliefs over the intervening 1900 years.  These Christians can tell you what they believe, but they cannot tell you how those beliefs arose and mutated and found their way into the Christian belief-set and into the messages of today’s preachers.

I invite you to join me on a journey through time, watching as the Christian church found and grew into its unique place in Euro-American life.  As we go, we’ll consider how the Christian church responded to the various needs of its adherents and to the objections of its deniers, and how in the course of time, it has strayed from its embrace of the life-giving teachings of Jesus.",2022,English,9781387743193,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Matthew Skulicz,341,Paperback,Black & White,Digest (5.5 x 8.5 in / 140 x 216 mm),,"['truth', 'belief', 'religion', 'personal spiritual seeking', 'Roman Catholic Church', 'Christianity', 'Christian history', 'misuse of Christian religion', 'degradation of Christianity', 'weaponizing Christianity', 'slavery', 'persecution of Jews', 'teachings of Jesus', 'Jesus', 'Holy Roman Empire', 'bishops', 'early Christian communities', 'Christian orthdoxy', 'Christ the King', 'priest sex scandal', 'Source of All Things', 'spiritual freedom', 'bible study', 'discussion groups', 'spiritual growth', 'personal integration']"
"Jesus Won’t Save Us, But He Told Us How to Get Saved",Donald Werner,Ebook,USD 2.58,"Jesus clearly and unambiguously told was how to gain salvation, i.e., how get eternal life in YHVH’s kingdom.  But unfortunately the Christian Church has set Jesus’ words aside and are teaching and preaching salvation according to what Paul wrote. And what Paul wrote is contrary to what Jesus spoke.  So when people trust their salvation to what they hear in their Churches they hear Paul’s words and they are deceived.  
The Christian Church is nothing like it was when founded by Jesus’ disciples.  We read about that pure Apostolic Church in the Book of Acts. That Apostolic Church followed Jesus’ commands and instructions, and keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.  However, over the centuries the Christian Church has changed dramatically, it has mutated in a bad way, having been corrupted and polluted with non-Biblical doctrines and creeds.  The Christian Church leaders struggled to remove all traces of Judaism from the Church, and in doing that they removed the faith of Jesus, who was the true Jew.  They throw out the baby with the bath water.  Today’s Christian Church is far away from the clear reading of YHVH’s Commands and Jesus’ words and instructions.  Jesus had many warnings about such deceptions, but people failed to recognize the deceptions and fell for them, hook line and sinker – because those deceptions came from a most unexpected source – their own churches. And now God calls His people to get out of the corrupt religious system, “Come out of her my people”.  What is the deception? What is the church corruption and how did it happen?  Would God allow corruption to defile His church? How can I make sure it doesn’t happen to me?

His Young Friends,Dale Weatherford,Paperback,USD 45.84,"HIS YOUNG FRIENDS is a chapter book for juvenile readers.   Each story focuses on a child that might have encountered Jesus while He was on earth.

While the characters are fiction, the events are based on manuscripts written in the first century A.D., and references are given to the Biblical text.   Each of the 22 stories stands alone, but together they explore the earthly life of Jesus Christ.  Each story contains quotes from the Bible.

Yehudah Rising,Dr. Beverley M. Anderson,Ebook,USD 17.78,"The concept of ""Yehudah Rising"" began with one individual who was convinced that she was a descendant of the ancient Hebrews. Her inner-standing of Temple Worship formed the basis on which her personal story became a wonderful unravelling. Dr Beverley was born into a family that displayed Levitical tendencies, resembling the priestly order characterised by attention to detail, and discipline.  The Most High took Dr Beverley by the hand and led her on a journey through the Great Doors of True Worship. Without reliable family evidence to draw on, she asked the Most-High to show her what to do and where to look.  She believed He knew the end from the beginning of her bloodline because His Word says, 'He is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that I could dare to ask or even think according to the power that is at work in me.' I believed that statement to mean: 'If I am able to have faith, He will work according to the level of my faith.' Well, I held onto my strong convictions until, through many years of research the truth began to shine through. Chattel Slavery was largely responsible for erasing and covering up the ancient Hebrew heritage of the Caribbean people. Dr Beverley didn't know where the pieces of her personal history were hidden. The Most High uncovered the tissue of lies; endemic to the fabric of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This book is both a historical research and a biblical retracing of the steps that our ancient Hebrew forefathers took, from being a Nation to becoming a Slave Population. My brothers and sisters have suffered four hundred years in Mental Slavery, because we broke our Sacred Covenant with the Most-High. In fact, the reason we are unable to unite as a Hebrew Community, is because we broke our union with the Most-High. It’s as simple as that. The biographical style of this book enables the Negro Jamaican Hebrew to emotionally reconnect with historical facts by offering the reader a peak into Dr. Beverley's past up to the present day.
