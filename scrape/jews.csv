the Jewish nation ceased to exist with the moment when its
political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the
later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of
which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of
Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the
product of the schools rather than the product of practical,
pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings

Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand.

post-Biblical times by those who conceived the Judaism of the
later epoch to be something different from the Judaism of the
Bible, something actually opposed to it. Such observers held that
the Jewish nation ceased to exist with the moment when its
political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the
later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of
which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of
Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the
product of the schools rather than the product of practical,
pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings

Print Wikipedia is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture towards the inhuman scale of big data. Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand. Print Wikipedia draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of date. It is also a work of found poetry built on what is likely the largest appropriation ever made.

The position of the Jews in Spain and Portugal during a great part of the middle ages forms an exceptionally bright spot in their dark and chequered history, and developed some striking intellectual and moral features in an age when a great part of what now constitutes Civilisation was wrapped in mental darkness. The favoured position of the Jews in the Peninsula induced a vast Hebrew population to settle there; and although it became evident, after a time, that their prosperity, attracting, as it did, the jealousy of the bulk of people, would lead to their ultimate ruin, this could only be effected in a long and gradual manner, and could only be consummated by a cruel and violent measureâ€”their forced expulsion.",2013,English,9781300649465,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Frederic David Mocatta,,,,,EPUB,"['Portugal', 'Jews', 'Spain']"

At Jesus' time salvation was of the Jews because no other religion had the oracles of YHVH God. So Jesus came to seek and save the lost Gentiles, and the lost Jews.  Jesus brought reformation to Judaism, which changed under Jesus' influence - so it again would be a channel for God's saving grace.  And for the non-Jew, Jesus didn't come to start a new Christian Religion, Jesus came to gather that other flock (non-Jews) to his flock (Judaism) (John 10:16). so there would be one flock with one shepherd.  All Jesus told us to do for salvation, is what Judaism practices; keeping YHVH 'law and the Prophets' (Matthew 5:17-20) and to worship YHVH alone (Matthew 4:10). Those in the Christian Church do neither because they have been deceived by the 'most cunning of beast', the serpent beast from the Garden of Eden.

This objective satisfied the powerful propaganda in those years by the spokesman of the great international Jewish organizations, which sought to obtain a â€œreview and a purificationâ€ of the Christian teaching in respect to Judaism.

"Why did Jesus Say, Salvation is of the Jews?",Donald Werner,Paperback,USD 9.64,"What did Jesus mean when he said, ""Salvation is of the Jews""?  Jesus spoke this to a Samaritan woman who was not a Jew. At Jesus' time salvation was of the Jews because no other religion had the oracles of YHVH God. So Jesus came to seek and save the lost Gentiles, and the lost Jews.  Jesus brought reformation to Judaism, which changed under Jesus' influence - so it again would be a channel for God's saving grace.  And for the non-Jew, Jesus didn't come to start a new Christian Religion, Jesus came to gather that other flock (non-Jews) to his flock (Judaism) (John 10:16). so there would be one flock with one shepherd.  Jesus told us what to do for salvation, and what he told us is what Judaism practices; keeping YHVHâ€™s 'law and the Prophets' (Matthew 5:17-20) and to worship YHVH alone (Matthew 4:10). Those in the Christian Church do neither because they have been deceived by the 'most cunning of beast', the serpent beast from the Garden of Eden.  How does Judaism and Christianity differ on Keeping God's commandments, worship, prayer, forgiveness, love of God, fear of God, need for righteousness, means of righteousness, nature of God, personal behavior and salvation.

Jesus was a Jew, and he very clearly and succinctly gave us instructions on how to gain eternal life.  So one would think that Jesus' message would be held in high esteem and kept.

In October 1944, Nazi Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann, with the eager assistance of the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross party, initiated plans to finish off the Jews of Budapest even as the Soviet Red Army was rapidly advancing, and ultimately laid siege on Budapest in December 1944.

The house was converted into a hospital run by Jewish doctors designed to treat everyone -- even their wounded enemies, free of charge.  The Jewish residents were ultimately saved in this way by a man who posed as an Arrow Cross officer and risked his own life countless times while over 70,000 Jews were being murdered at the Danube or dying in ghettos.

They came through the purges of the 30s and 50s in Soviet Ukraine, but nevertheless decided to emigrate to Germany during the nascent new independent democratic society of Ukraine. The fate of the family was not an accident, but was a reflection of a certain historical culture and treatment of these human lives. On the other hand, the main ""character"" of the novel is the system and the collective historical subject of that system. The content, in its own way, articulates an issue of the collective peopleâ€™s guilt in relation to the Jewish nation.",2021,English,N/A,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,"Other primary creator: Victoria Kutkina, By (author): Kim Zaslavsky",417,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['jews', 'jewish', 'holocaust', 'prosecution of jews', 'immigration of jews', 'holocaust in germany']"

The courage, sympathy, and dedication of the Ribouleaus stood in strong contrast to the collaborations of the French authorities.

In this book, I have organized this history chronologically.  It shows a pattern repeated again and again from the Roman period through the present day. We witness Crusades, Inquisitions, Expulsions and Pogroms, all of which culminated in the Holocaust.  As we study this history we can see the year-by-year, decade-by-decade and century-by-century operation of the spirit of anti-Semitism.  History shows us when, where and how it spread. It temporarily subsides in one place and then emerges in another.

Hitler's War and the Horrific Account of the Holocaust,Scott S. F. Meaker,Ebook,USD 1.85,"**Please Note: Hitlerâ€™s War and the Horrific Account of the Holocaust is a short book**

-:The Holocaust remains as a reference to the destruction of about six million Jews. The collection of undesirables began in 1933 with the construction of the first concentration camp. As Hitlerâ€™s power grew, he rounded up others that he considered undesirable. Hitler had come into power and the slow destruction of Jews was put into place. In 1942, about a million Jews had already been killed. Execution was just one cause of death. Two and a half million have been gassed and a half million starved to death. Typhus outbreak killed many others after the Allied victory.

Jewish Prayers to an Evolutionary God: Science In the Siddur,Joel Yehudah Rutman MD,Ebook,USD 8.99,"Why do we pray? On the one hand, prayer offers us a way to meditate on the knowledge of God and have intimate interaction with a personal creator. And for many Jews, it offers a sense of community and fulfils a need for daily connection with a venerable tradition and language. Yet for many modern Jews, prayer is at best old fashionedâ€”or at worst, no longer necessary. In Jewish Prayers to an Evolutionary God: Science in the Siddur, author Dr. Joel Rutman provides a new way of understanding the existing language of Jewish prayer, and he integrates science with Jewish liturgyâ€”all the while striving to preserve the passion that makes prayer matter. The aim is to enable Jews to daven (pray) with kavanna (intent), trusting that science will not pull the rug out from under their prayer.

Part of this restoration is recognizing that anti-Semitism is more than a merely human social, economic, or political phenomenon focused on the persecution or destruction of Jewish people. Working with the spirit of anti-Christ, they have created satanic strategies focused on preventing the Second Coming of Jesus.

Is there anyone out there who is Jewish, who was attracted to the love of the Jesus Movement, who worked as a teacher in a Pentecostal Christian school, who lived in a Christian commune, who attended a deaf church, who served for years with Jews for Jesus as a volunteer and also a missionary, who spoke in hundreds of churches, who worked for Focus on the Family, who led a cause to expose the ""wrongs"" of Jews for Jesus, who also taught skating for years, who raised her children as secular Jews, who sought G-d in Orthodox Judaism, whose husband almost died in a horrible accident, who unschooled her children, and who became ""sort of famous"" because of her writing about figure skating?

Perhaps Jonah and I also have something in common...

I do hope that whoever reads my story will enjoy getting to know me and at the same time be entertained. 

Happy reading!

A Distant Dream,Levi Kaufman,Ebook,USD 2.99,"A Distant Dream, an historical novel, is set against the vivid backdrop of Medieval Europe and the religious hostility that was its hallmark. In the year 1290, England's twelve thousand Jews became the continent's first community to face expulsion. Despite oppressive and unfair taxes and restrictive living conditions, the Jews had somehow managed to survive and even prosper. Now they were to be forced to abandon their homes and belongings. Where should the uprooted families go? Would any other Christian nations welcome them? Would they be allowed to remain in any one place for more than a few years? 
Perhaps some tired and idealistic English Jew dreamed of cutting his ancient ties with Europe altogether. Perhaps he spoke to others around him and together, they make plans. Perhaps there were some who dared to set out for some new land where they could live their lives as Jews.

What The Bible Teaches About The Future,Peter Bloomfield,Paperback,USD 20.00,"The Bible has an amazing record of being right about the future.  In fact, it has never been wrong, not once, ever.  
If you've ever wondered what the future holds or what is on the horizon for our planet and for individuals, then this book will help answer your questions.  Some of the issues dealt with in this book are: What happens after we die? How will God judge people? What is the future of Israel? Who will be let into heaven? What is the mark of the beast?
The biblical books are like navigation charts, marking out points of progress along the way - the landmarks, the safe channels, the reefs where men get shipwrecked.  We can know with certainty what to expect just over the horizon.  This book will help you to do just that - to know where our eternal destiny lies and what it will be like when we get there.  The Bible tells us all we need to know, and we know we can trust it.",2021,English,9781667139845,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Peter Bloomfield,187,Paperback,Black & White,Royal (6.14 x 9.21 in / 156 x 234 mm),,"['heaven', 'judgement', 'Jews', 'future']"

This has been a peculiarly difficult task where Jews are concerned, for the vision of the world has been obscured by darkly bias-tinted spectacles. If, on the one hand, Christological and anti-Semitic prejudices have revealed only an infamous horde of blasphemers and parasites, on the other, a historical perspective limited by Scripture has disclosed an exalted band of prophets, hounded and persecuted as prophets must be for their vision and temerity. Between these two extremesâ€”which have alike doomed Jews to the unhappiest of careersâ€”a normal people, with all the faults and virtues of humanity, has pursued its normal course through history, however abnormal were the conditions against which it struggled.",2011,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Joshua Trachtenberg,,,,,PDF,"['jewish', 'magic']"

THE MYSTERY OF JEWISH HISTORY,Vladimir Moss,Paperback,USD 27.89,"â€œThe  Jewish  Questionâ€  remains  as  topical  â€“  and  controversial  â€“  as  ever.  Some Orthodox  Christians  speak  and  write  on  little  else,  considering  it  to  be  the  question, the  question  that  everyone  must  understand  if  they  are  to  understand  the  essence of  the  modern  world  and  of  Christian  history  in  general.  They  see  the  fount  of  all evil  in  the  manipulation  of  world  events  by  a  small  sect  of  God-hating  and  manhating  Talmudist  rabbis.  Others  are  shocked  by  this  attitude,  considering  it  to  be anti-semitic,  and  turn  away  in  disgust  whenever  the  subject  is  raised.  They  regard any  such  idea  as  serious  sin,  lack  of  love  and  the  prolongation  of  the  lies  that  incited the  pogroms  and  the holocaust. If  we  turn  to  the  Holy  Scriptures  and  Church  Tradition,  then  we  find  some confirmation  for  both  points  of  view.  On  the  one  hand,  the  Apostle  Paul  calls  the Jews  who  reject  Christ  â€œdogsâ€  (Philippians  3.2);  he  devotes  a  whole  epistle (Galatians),  and  large  parts  of  other  epistles,  to  the  threat  of  the  Judaizers;  and  in general  treats  the  Jews  as  the  main  enemies  of  the  Christians.  On  the  other  hand,  he writes:  â€œHas  God  cast  away  His  people?  God  forbidâ€  (Romans  11.1);  he  warns  the Christian  Gentiles  not  to  boast  or  be  high-minded  in  relation  to  the  Jews,  but  to  fear lest  they  themselves  fall  away  (Romans  11.20);  for  â€œhardness  in  part  has  come  upon Israel  until  the  fullness  of  Gentiles  has  come  in.  And  so  all  Israel  [believing  Jews  and Gentiles  together] shall be savedâ€ (Romans  11.25-26). So  what  is  the  truth  about  the  Jews?  And  what  should  be  our  attitude  towards them?  In  attempting  to  answer  these  questions,  I  shall  adopt  an  historical  approach, beginning  with  the  Jewsâ€™  calling  by  God  through  Abraham  to  become  Godâ€™s  people, the  chosen  race,  until  their  apostasy  from  Christ  in  the  first  century  (parts  I  and  II); continuing  with  the  long  period  in  which  they  lived  primarily  under  Christian rulers  of  one  kind  or  another  (part  III);  then  their  emergence  onto  modern  history after  the  French  revolution  as  an  independent  political  force  to  be  reckoned  with  by all  other  players  (part  IV).",2021,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Vladimir Moss,311,Paperback,Black & White,A4 (8.27 x 11.69 in / 210 x 297 mm),,"['Judaism', 'Orthodox Christianity', 'Jews', 'Church of God', 'Betrayal']"

Despite oppressive and unfair taxes and restrictive living conditions, the Jews had somehow managed to survive and even prosper.  Now they were to be forced to abandon their homes and belongings.
Where should the uprooted families go?  Would any other Christian nations welcome them?  Would they be allowed to remain in any one place for more than a few years?
Perhaps some tired and idealistic English Jew dreamed of breaking away from Europe and the ever-deepening anguish of his exiled people.  Perhaps he spoke to others around him and, together, they make plans.  Perhaps there were some who dared to set out for some new land where they could live their lives as Jews.  Where they could live undisturbed by the outside worldâ€¦

Terror Has No Diary: Annals of a Gay Jew and His Comrads Behind a Holy Wall in Nazi Europe,Michael Melnick,Paperback,USD 15.00,"Of the 7000 Jews living in the Baltic seaport of Libau (Liepaja), Latvia when the Germans invaded on June 21, 1941, only 200 remained alive when the city was liberated May 9,1945. Of these, maybe two dozen were hiding within Libau itself. This story is about 12 of them. Eleven adults were in the care of Robert and Johanna Sedols who hid them in a cellar behind a false wall constructed with the ""holy bricks"" of the demolished Choral Synagogue; the lone child was cared for by a widow, Otilija Schimelpfenig, in the secure comfort of her home.

Kapporos Then and Now: Toward a More Compassionate Tradition,Yonassan Gershom,Paperback,USD 14.00,"Every year, right before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, there is a cultural war in certain Jewish neighborhoods over a ceremony called Kapporos, in which a chicken is slaughtered just before the holy day.  The animal rights people show up claiming, â€œMeat is murder!â€ while the Orthodox and Hasidic Jews who practice this ceremony accuse the activists of antisemitism and violating their freedom of religion.  Epithets fly and confrontations occur across the barricades, but nobody is really listening to each other.
  
Rabbi Gershom seeks to build a bridge of understanding between these two warring camps.  On the one hand, he opposes using live chickens as Kapporos, and, like many other religious Jews before him, advocates giving money to charity instead.  But on the other hand, he is himself a Hasid who understands and believes in the kabbalistic principle of ""raising holy sparks"" so central to the ceremony.

Why Giving Is Better Than Tithing,C.N Chris,Ebook,USD 3.00,"Since God is love, Why would such God wish to curse people who are under grace with a curse, call them robbers and destroy their businesses just because they did not pay tithe to religious houses as the law demands? The law came through Moses, not for the whole world but for the Jews only. The grace came through Jesus Christ, not for the Jews only but for the whole world. So tithe and its curses are Moses Jewish laws, not Jesus laws from God. The only law from God through Jesus is Love. God loves a cheerful giver but tithing is not cheerful.

Tithing is not by cheerful giving but a command with the law of tithe as payment. Those who are afraid of devourers or being called a robber by the God of Malachi can struggle to keep the law of paying tithe yet they are not Jews since sacrifice and tithes are not accepted from the gentiles by the God of Malachi.

The Message,John Thatcher,Paperback,USD 6.28,"Finally, a book about Noadiah - the final  prophet of the Old Testament. Her story compels us to see the days of Ezra and Nehemiah from a new perspective.
They were desolate days in Jerusalem.
The Jews had killed the beloved prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, but Ezra the scribe and Nehemiah the Persian appointed Governor of Judea, omitted his murder from their glorious records reverberating with Jewish lineage and self-praise.
It took the coming of Jesus, the light to the Gentiles, to illuminate the dark acts of the Jews -
""Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, â€˜If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.â€™...upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.""  Matthew 23:29-35
Stephen also said of the Jews -
Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute?
We need to see the history of the Jews through the lens of Jesus. When Nehemiah recorded that Noadiah and all the prophets were trying to intimidate him, were his actions right, or was it Noadiah and the other prophets who were right to oppose him?

Moses Jakob Kasser volunteered to serve in the British army and was placed in the 87th Company of the Alien Pioneer Corps together with a number of other Jewish volunteers with a German background.
This book also contains copies of some of his correspondence (draft letters, letters, postcards, and airgraphs) in their original language (English, German, Hebrew and Yiddish) providing a treasure trove of material for further research. 
This book also describes a number of incidents including what happened after the official Jewish Chaplain had the audacity to repeat his previous yearâ€™s Yom Kippur sermon on the following Rosh Hashanah and accidently omitted a page without noticing, while his audience did and that led to some â€˜fighting in Britainâ€™.",2013,English,9781304688927,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Moses Jakob Kasser,,,,,EPUB,"['pioneer corps', 'postal history', 'german jews']"

Few if any Christians can answer as the answer to this question is tied to the obscure origins of Christianity which this book opens wide. The authentic nature of the Ruach Elohim or Spirit of G-d is radically different from the one put forward in Christianity's dearest doctrine. The ancient Jewish understanding of the Ruach depicts this Holy Spirit to be Her, the Wisdom and Glory, the Shechinah of G-d/the Elohim in all of the authentically Jewish penned Scriptures.

Standing Against Anti-semitism,Howard Morgan,Ebook,USD 7.00,"Every disciple of Jesus, must understand that the Body of Christ has Hebraic Roots and a relationship/responsibility to Jewish people. Presently, God is restoring this understanding to the Church.

Part of this restoration is recognizing that anti-Semitism is more than a merely human social, economic, or political phenomenon focused on the persecution or destruction of Jewish people. Along with the spirit of anti-Christ, they have created satanic strategies focused on preventing the Second Coming of Jesus. 

Dr. Morgan shows the significance of aligning with Godâ€™s prophetic purposes for the Church and Jewish people.  There is a great spiritual battle opposing everyone who confronts anti-Semitism and participates in Godâ€™s purposes for the Church and Jewish people.

Next, â€œThe Preservers,â€ tells how a rabbi who is obsessed with preserving whatever artifacts of Jewish life and religion he can find given how much has been destroyed. The last, ""The Pinkas Wall,"" tells of an American Jewish foreign correspondent in post-WW II Czechoslovakia who reflects on the Nazi occupation, while experiencing the contemporary oppression of another anti-Semitic regime under Stalinism.",2011,English,N/A,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Abraham Rothberg,,,,,PDF,"['Holocaust', 'Jewish experience']"

Hebrew Salvation,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 20.00,"Many among the Peoples in the West are to a significant degree of Hebrew Descent. In Ancient Times they had separated from Judah (the present-day Jews) and created their own Kingdom. Eventually they were conquered by the Assyrians. They moved via different pathways of migration to the west. The Prophet Hosea in the Bible described the situation today in Western Nations. He also referred to events in the past and in his own time. Megalithic Monuments, such as dolmens, were to be found in the Land of Israel. The Hebrews when they moved westward were told to put such monuments up along their route to serve in the future as evidence of their Hebrew Origins! It was prophesied that the Ten Tribes will re-unite with Judah. Many will return to the Land of Israel. For others the Lands they are now in will become part of the Holy Land! The return will be preceded by a War between the Ten Tribes, headed by Ephraim, and the forces of Edom. The Lost Israelites may have to fight against certain Non-Israelite Nations. Ephraim (i.e. the Ten Tribes of Israel) will repent. Rabbi Moshe David Valle, a Rabbinical Mystic in the 1700s, interpreted passages in the Book of Hosea as saying that Ephraim in the End Times will have completed his task. Henceforth there will be no more need for Ephraim to remain hidden and in Exile. This study involves matters of great importance for many in the West Today.

JEWISH MAGIC AND SUPERSTITION,Joshua Trachtenberg,Paperback,USD 20.88,"TO UNDERSTAND a peopleâ€”and through it, humankindâ€”is to see its life whole. This has been a peculiarly difficult task where Jews are concerned, for the vision of the world has been obscured by darkly bias-tinted spectacles. If, on the one hand, Christological and anti-Semitic prejudices have revealed only an infamous horde of blasphemers and parasites, on the other, a historical perspective limited by Scripture has disclosed an exalted band of prophets, hounded and persecuted as prophets must be for their vision and temerity. Between these two extremesâ€”which have alike doomed Jews to the unhappiest of careersâ€”a normal people, with all the faults and virtues of humanity, has pursued its normal course through history, however abnormal were the conditions against which it struggled.",2009,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Joshua Trachtenberg,365,Paperback,Black & White,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,"['jewish', 'magic']"

Judenhass,Dave Sim,Paperback,USD 8.21,"I decided some time ago that the term anti-Semitism (a 'coined' term of late nineteenth century origin) is completely inadequate to the abhorrent cultural phenomenon which it attempts to describe. For one thing, Arabs are Semites as well and the prejudice as it generally understood certainly doesn't apply equally to Arabs and Jews.

It was in the early stages of researching this graphic narrative that I first encountered the German term Judenhass. Literally, Jew-Hatred. It seemed to me that the term served to distill the ancient problem to its essence, and in such a way as to hopefully allow other non-Jews (like myself) to see the problem 'unlaundered' and through fresh eyes. Europe and various other jurisdictions aren't experiencing a sudden upsurge in 'anti-Semitism'. What they are experiencing is an upsurge in Judenhass -- Jew-Hatred. 

So that's what I've chosen to call this story.

Zaid lived through it, lost his entire family to an uncaring German firing squad, and knows the truth.

Redemption of the Transgressions,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"When the Roman Republic conquered Judea, they turned it into a Roman province. But, the land of ancient Israel was predominantly Jewish until the Jewishâ€“Roman wars. During the wars, the Roman Empire expelled most of the Jews from that land and formed the Roman province of Syria Palaestina, beginning a new period in Jewish history known as the diaspora. After this time, Jews became a minority in most regions of the land of Israel, except in Galilee. The area became increasingly Christianized after the 3rd century of the resurrection of Christ: Christians dominated in urban areas, and Jews remained in rural areas. Jewish settlements declined by the time of the Muslim conquest of the Levant. Then the forces of the First Crusade conquered Jerusalem and nearby coastal areas, forming the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Over the following 200 years, Crusader forces lost and recaptured Jerusalem until their final ouster from Acre. Then the Holy Land was made part of the Ottoman Empire, and Turks ruled it until the British conquered it. The region was ruled under the British Mandate for Palestine; but the pivotal fulfillment of prophecy came when the Jewish State of Israel was proclaimed in part of the ancient land of Israel. This was made possible by the Zionist movement and its promotion of mass Jewish immigration - and Israel began to flourish again, to prepare God's people for the 21st century...all the while, waiting for the redemption of their transgressions.",2021,English,N/A,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,,,,,EPUB,['faith']

Edward (15) survived the Holocaust by an audacious lie invented by his father: his mother, Erica, would claim to be a German foundling raised by a Jewish family. The ploy didnâ€™t save his father, who was shot along with 98% of the Jews in Latvia, but it gave Erica the provisional status of an Aryan and her two sons that of half-Jews. The scheme became a cat-and-mouse game with skeptical Nazi officials; the family gleaned one temporary reprieve after another as they amassed bogus documentation of German ancestryâ€”the author used his knowledge of chemistry to alter identity papersâ€”always aware that one false step could land them in a mass grave. He tells this harrowing story with absorbing lucidity, with a simple moral visionâ€”â€œI met enough decent, brave, and noble Germans and Latvians during the war to be immunized against prejudiceâ€â€”that resonates. A testament of remarkable clarity and humanity, wrung from dark experience.

Davidâ€™s Rise to Power,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"David is a living legend of Hebrew history, and this is a presentation of him from a Greek point of view: a view which found its way into the English language. Davidâ€™s rise to power starts with the story of a man of God named Samuel. As a child, Samuel lived in a house of worship. The Lord singled him out as a prophet, and the childâ€™s first prophecy was one of judgment on the corrupt priests. This was when Samuelâ€™s people, the people of Israel, got used to being in constant battles with their most famous enemy, the Philistines. The Philistines capture the ark of the covenant, Messiahâ€™s earthly gift to Israel, but when the Creator sends judgment, the Philistines return the ark. Samuel calls Israel to repentance, and then to victory over the Philistines. But that was not enough for Israel: wanting to be like other nations, they desired a king. Samuel is displeased by their demands, but God the Father tells him that it is not Samuelâ€™s leadership they are rejecting, but his own. After warning the people of what having a king would mean, Samuel anoints a man named Saul. Saul enjoys initial success, but then he makes a series of missteps: he presumptuously offers a sacrifice, he makes a foolish vow at the expense of his son Jonathan, and he disobeys the heavenly Fatherâ€™s direct command.

Hebrew Destiny,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 20.00,"""Hebrew Destiny"" describes how the Lost Ten Tribes are to be found in Countries of the West. This message needs to be spread.

Hosea foresaw that ""Ephraim"" would attempt to come to an understanding with followers of this person. The consequences are liable to result in disaster. In addition, ""Ephraim"" will be deluded and afflicted due to rampant sexual immorality. Hosea recalls how these same sins led to the Ten Tribes going into Exile. They lost awareness of their ancestry. The Phoenician Edomites of Tyre and the Minoan Sailors of Phillistia under Edomite direction served as agents for Assyria. They set up colonies in the west to work the mines and to grow crops to supply the Assyrian Empire. Israelites were taken in ships as captives to settle in such places. They were also taken overland to other areas. From there too, they came westward. Descendants of Ephraim are still to be found among Western nations and their offshoots. They are called upon to repent. The presence of many from the Lost Ten Tribes in North America in our times had been predicted. Judah will have remained basically faithful.

About the author:

Felix Salten (6 September 1869 â€“ 8 October 1945) was an Austrian author and critic in Vienna. His most famous work is Bambi, a Life in the Woods (1923).Salten was born Siegmund Salzmann in Budapest, Hungary. When he was four weeks old, his family relocated to Vienna, Austria. Many Jews were immigrating into the city during the late 19th century because Vienna had granted full citizenship to Jews in 1867.When his father became bankrupt, the sixteen-year-old Salten quit school and began working for an insurance agency. He also began submitting poems and book reviews to journals. He became part of the ""Young Vienna"" movement (Jung Wien) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic for Vienna's press (Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung, Zeit). In 1900 he published his first collection of short stories.

Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians,Charles Hodge,Ebook,USD 2.99,"In the introduction to his commentary, Charles Hodge investigates the sociopolitical climate of the city of Ephesus prior to Paul's first visit. Ephesus was famous for its idolatrous practices of sorcery and divination. Upon arriving in Ephesus, Paul and his disciples spread the word of Jesus to the wayward Jews and Greeks, and many were converted. A flourishing Church was established, and several years after his visit to Ephesus, Paul wrote to the Ephesians while imprisoned in Rome. Paul wrote this letter to praise God for the gift of redemption and to guide the Christians of Ephesus in the light of the Holy Ghost. Several sections of the epistle focus on godly social interactions. This epistle was in large part intended to encourage unity between newly converted Jews and the rest of the Christian community. Hodge's careful scrutiny gives readers a newly informed look at Paul's letter to the Christians at Ephesus. -Emmalon Davis, CCEL Staff Writer",2010,English,9781610250948,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Charles Hodge,,,,,EPUB,"['ccel', 'christian', 'god', 'christ', 'christianity', 'spirituality', 'classics', 'christian classics', 'ethereal', 'jesus', 'religion', 'commentary', 'hodge', 'ephesus', 'ephesians', 'paul', 'epistle', 'church']"

Standing Against Anti-Semitism,Howard Morgan,Paperback,USD 15.00,"Every disciple of Jesus, must understand that the Body of Christ has Hebraic Roots and a relationship/responsibility to Jewish people. Presently, God is restoring this understanding to the Church. Part of this restoration is recognizing that anti-Semitism is more than a merely human social, economic, or political phenomenon focused on the persecution or destruction of Jewish people. Working with the spirit of anti-Christ, they have created satanic strategies focused on preventing the Second Coming of Jesus.

Hebrew Warriors,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 40.00,"The ""KHAZARS"" became prominent in southern Russia and its neighborhood in the 600s to 900s CE.  They were  powerful with a far-reaching influence and well-developed civilization. They protected the Jews while giving full citizenship rights to Christians and Moslems who served them faithfully. The ""KHAZARS"" converted to Judaism and henceforth were Jewish.
The Khazars were related to the Picts of Scotland and to other groups who settled in Scandinavia, France, and the British Isles.
Proofs concerning the Israelite origins of the Khazars of necessity also do the same for the nations they were of kinship with.
The Khazars were descended from a mixture of remnants of the Ten Tribes, Jewish refugees whose religious affiliation had blurred, and Gentile descendants of Gomer. A movement to return to Judaism began among them. Due to the uncertainty of their lineages the Rabbis declared them all Gentiles and then converted them to Judaism as the Bible and Tradition allowed them to do.
Descendants of the Khazars may still be found among some Jewish communities but only as a minority element and indistinguishable from other Jews.
Nevertheless, it is both important and of interest to know more about them.
The Khazars are symbolic of the Israelite People in general. It should be worth our while to be aware of this.
Part of the Scottish people descend from the Agathyrsi who were a branch of the Khazars.",2019,English,9781678027179,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Yair Davidiy,218,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Khazars', 'Hebrews', 'Converts', 'Red Jews', 'Agathyrsi', 'Picts', 'Armenia', 'Hungary', 'Central Asia', 'Scaninavia', 'Sweden', 'Birka', 'Archaeology']"

The Message,John Thatcher,Ebook,USD 0.00,"Finally, a book about Noadiah - the final prophet of the Old Testament history books. Her story compels us to see the days of Ezra and Nehemiah from a new perspective.
They were desolate days in Jerusalem.
The Jews had killed the beloved prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, but Ezra the scribe and Nehemiah the Persian appointed Governor of Judea, omitted it from their glorious records reverberating with Jewish lineage and self-praise.
It took the coming of Jesus, the light to the Gentiles, to illuminate the dark acts of the Jews -
""Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, â€˜If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.â€™...upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.""  Matthew 23:29-35
We need to see the history of the Jews through the lens of Jesus. When Nehemiah recorded that Noadiah and all the prophets were trying to intimidate him, were his actions right, or was it Noadiah and the other prophets who were right to oppose him?  
John Thatcher combines a lifetime of Bible study with great insight, to present the closing acts of the Old Testament as a warning to perceive that the things that are of God, and the things that are of men.

There are two rival historical-fiction interpretations of Revelation: ""Left Behind"" by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and ""The Last Disciple"" by Hank Hanegraaff and Sigmund Brouwer.  LaHaye's is futurist, meaning that most of the predictions will happen in the future.  Hanegraaff's is preterist, meaning that many of the predictions have already happened as the Christian Church formed in the first and second centuries.  Hanegraaff's book is handicapped because the average reader can't distinguish the real characters and events from the fictional ones.  I know the history very well because I researched and wrote a preterist interpretation, which I condensed into my present book.  I provide the historical facts of that period and show how the facts relate to Revelation.

Kapporos Then And Now,Yonassan Gershom,Ebook,USD 5.00,"Every year, right before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, there is a cultural war in certain Jewish neighborhoods over a ceremony called Kapporos, in which a chicken is slaughtered just before the holy day. The animal rights people show up claiming, â€œMeat is murder!â€ while the Orthodox and Hasidic Jews who practice this ceremony accuse the activists of antisemitism and violating their freedom of religion. Epithets fly and confrontations occur across the barricades, but nobody is really listening to each other. Rabbi Gershom seeks to build a bridge of understanding between these two warring camps. On the one hand, he opposes using live chickens as Kapporos, and, like many other religious Jews before him, advocates giving money to charity instead. But on the other hand, he is himself a Hasid who understands and believes in the kabbalistic principle of ""raising holy sparks"" so central to the ceremony. In fact, he says, it is that very mysticism that has led him not to use chickens for the ritual.",2021,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Yonassan Gershom,,,,,PDF,"['Kapparot', 'Kapporos', 'animal welfare', 'animal rights', 'Judaism', 'Hasidism', 'Yonassan Gershom']"

How Did A Hebrew Like You Become An Enthusiast of Yeshua?,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"This book is my way of saying that Zola Levitt was the best employer I ever had: I say that now because, since my time at Zola's ministry as his worker, God the Son arranged my life in such a way that I no longer had to depend on earthly employers, allowing me to fully engage in my heavenly calling. The reason why I worked for Zola was because he ended up being one of the best teachers I ever knew. I felt it was time to resurrect a story which has been partially hidden for a long time. Zola is dead now, but he is dancing in heaven.

Davidâ€™s Rise to Power,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 25.00,"David is a living legend of Hebrew history, and this is a presentation of him from a Greek point of view: a view which found its way into the English language. Davidâ€™s rise to power starts with the story of a man of God named Samuel. As a child, Samuel lived in a house of worship. The Lord singled him out as a prophet, and the childâ€™s first prophecy was one of judgment on the corrupt priests. This was when Samuelâ€™s people, the people of Israel, got used to being in constant battles with their most famous enemy, the Philistines. The Philistines capture the ark of the covenant, Messiahâ€™s earthly gift to Israel, but when the Creator sends judgment, the Philistines return the ark. Samuel calls Israel to repentance, and then to victory over the Philistines. But that was not enough for Israel: wanting to be like other nations, they desired a king. Samuel is displeased by their demands, but God the Father tells him that it is not Samuelâ€™s leadership they are rejecting, but his own. After warning the people of what having a king would mean, Samuel anoints a man named Saul. Saul enjoys initial success, but then he makes a series of missteps: he presumptuously offers a sacrifice, he makes a foolish vow at the expense of his son Jonathan, and he disobeys the heavenly Fatherâ€™s direct command. That is how David shows upâ€¦and if you want to find out what happens next and how it all ended up, you must open this book!",2022,English,9781387559091,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,108,Paperback,Black & White,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,"['faith', 'hope', 'love', 'David', 'Israel', 'Hebrews', 'Jews', 'kingdom', 'war', 'power']"

product of the schools rather than the product of practical,

Print Wikipedia is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture towards the inhuman scale of big data. Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand. Print Wikipedia draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of date. It is also a work of found poetry built on what is likely the largest appropriation ever made. As we become increasingly more dependent on information and source material on the Internet today, Mandiberg explores the accessibility of its vastness.",2015,English,9781329316911,Poetry,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Print Wikipedia,702,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Poetry', 'Reference', 'Wikipedia', 'Mandiberg']"

THE LEGENDS OF THE JEWS (1909),LOUIS GINZBERG TRANSLATED BY HENRIETTA SZOLD,Paperback,USD 23.17,"The term Rabbinic was applied to the Jewish Literature of 
post-Biblical times by those who conceived the Judaism of the
later epoch to be something different from the Judaism of the

the Jewish nation ceased to exist with the moment when its
political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the
later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of
which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of
Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the
product of the schools rather than the product of practical,
pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings
of morbid visionaries, is the material out of which these

The Legends of the Jews I,Louis Ginzberg,Hardcover,USD 45.00,"Volume 1- This is a massive collation of the Haggada--the traditions which have grown up surrounding the Biblical narrative. These stories and bits of layered detail are scattered throughout the Talmud and the Midrash, and other sources, including oral. In the 19th century Ginzberg undertook the task of arranging the Haggada into chronological order, and this series of volumes was the result. When God bestowed Paradise upon the first pair of mankind, He warned them particularly against carnal intercourse with each other. But after the fall of Eve, Satan, in the guise of the serpent, approached her, and the fruit of their union was Cain, the ancestor of all the impious generations that were rebellious toward God, and rose up against Him. Cainâ€™s descent from Satan, who is the angel Samael, was revealed in his seraphic appearance. At his birth, the exclamation was wrung from Eve, â€œI have gotten a man through an angel of the Lord.â€",2020,English,9781794851658,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Louis Ginzberg,410,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,['Legends Jews']

Print Wikipedia is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture towards the inhuman scale of big data. Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand. Print Wikipedia draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of date. It is also a work of found poetry built on what is likely the largest appropriation ever made.

The position of the Jews in Spain and Portugal during a great part of the middle ages forms an exceptionally bright spot in their dark and chequered history, and developed some striking intellectual and moral features in an age when a great part of what now constitutes Civilisation was wrapped in mental darkness. The favoured position of the Jews in the Peninsula induced a vast Hebrew population to settle there; and although it became evident, after a time, that their prosperity, attracting, as it did, the jealousy of the bulk of people, would lead to their ultimate ruin, this could only be effected in a long and gradual manner, and could only be consummated by a cruel and violent measureâ€”their forced expulsion.",2013,English,9781300649465,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Frederic David Mocatta,,,,,EPUB,"['Portugal', 'Jews', 'Spain']"

Jesus brought reformation to Judaism, which changed under Jesus' influence - so it again would be a channel for God's saving grace.  And for the non-Jew, Jesus didn't come to start a new Christian Religion, Jesus came to gather that other flock (non-Jews) to his flock (Judaism) (John 10:16). so there would be one flock with one shepherd.  All Jesus told us to do for salvation, is what Judaism practices; keeping YHVH 'law and the Prophets' (Matthew 5:17-20) and to worship YHVH alone (Matthew 4:10).

Behind an innocent appearance of ecumenical unity, of Christian charity, of common spiritual affiliation and of the reconciliation of the churches, this schema implies an act of the gravest consequence, since it implicitly asserted that for 2,000 years the Church was in error in this regard, and that it ought then to repair and completely revise its behavior toward the Jews. This objective satisfied the powerful propaganda in those years by the spokesman of the great international Jewish organizations, which sought to obtain a â€œreview and a purificationâ€ of the Christian teaching in respect to Judaism. This schema immediately aroused some violent reactions in the Muslim world and among Catholics of the Eastern Rite.

Jesus spoke this to a Samaritan woman who was not a Jew. At Jesus' time salvation was of the Jews because no other religion had the oracles of YHVH God. So Jesus came to seek and save the lost Gentiles, and the lost Jews.  Jesus brought reformation to Judaism, which changed under Jesus' influence - so it again would be a channel for God's saving grace.  And for the non-Jew, Jesus didn't come to start a new Christian Religion, Jesus came to gather that other flock (non-Jews) to his flock (Judaism) (John 10:16). so there would be one flock with one shepherd.  Jesus told us what to do for salvation, and what he told us is what Judaism practices; keeping YHVHâ€™s 'law and the Prophets' (Matthew 5:17-20) and to worship YHVH alone (Matthew 4:10). Those in the Christian Church do neither because they have been deceived by the 'most cunning of beast', the serpent beast from the Garden of Eden.

The house was converted into a hospital run by Jewish doctors designed to treat everyone -- even their wounded enemies, free of charge.  The Jewish residents were ultimately saved in this way by a man who posed as an Arrow Cross officer and risked his own life countless times while over 70,000 Jews were being murdered at the Danube or dying in ghettos.

Gradually 7 other Jews join them after hair-raising escapes.

Jewish Prayers to an Evolutionary God: Science in the Siddur,Joel Yehudah Rutman MD,Paperback,USD 12.99,"Why do we pray? On the one hand, prayer offers us a way to meditate on the knowledge of God and have intimate interaction with a personal creator. And for many Jews, it offers a sense of community and fulfils a need for daily connection with a venerable tradition and language. Yet for many modern Jews, prayer is at best old fashionedâ€”or at worst, no longer necessary. 

In Jewish Prayers to an Evolutionary God: Science in the Siddur, author Dr. Joel Rutman provides a new way of understanding the existing language of Jewish prayer, and he integrates science with Jewish liturgyâ€”all the while striving to preserve the passion that makes prayer matter. The aim is to enable Jews to daven (pray) with kavanna (intent), trusting that science will not pull the rug out from under their prayer.

This artistic form was chosen to tell a most important story. The novel is full of characters, events, the correlating atmosphere of the time, and life wisdom. On the one hand, the author traces the twists and turns of the life of the Brotmans, the family of a Jewish surgeon who survived Babi Yar in Kiev when it was occupied by fascists. They came through the purges of the 30s and 50s in Soviet Ukraine, but nevertheless decided to emigrate to Germany during the nascent new independent democratic society of Ukraine. The fate of the family was not an accident, but was a reflection of a certain historical culture and treatment of these human lives. On the other hand, the main ""character"" of the novel is the system and the collective historical subject of that system.

Hitler's War and the Horrific Account of the Holocaust,Scott S. F. Meaker,Ebook,USD 1.85,"**Please Note: Hitlerâ€™s War and the Horrific Account of the Holocaust is a short book**

-:The Holocaust remains as a reference to the destruction of about six million Jews. The collection of undesirables began in 1933 with the construction of the first concentration camp. As Hitlerâ€™s power grew, he rounded up others that he considered undesirable. Hitler had come into power and the slow destruction of Jews was put into place. In 1942, about a million Jews had already been killed. Execution was just one cause of death. Two and a half million have been gassed and a half million starved to death. Typhus outbreak killed many others after the Allied victory.

Standing Against Anti-Semitism,Howard Morgan,Paperback,USD 10.00,"Every disciple of Jesus, must understand that the Body of Christ has Hebraic Roots and a relationship/responsibility to Jewish people. Presently, God is restoring this understanding to the Church.

Part of this restoration is recognizing that anti-Semitism is more than a merely human social, economic, or political phenomenon focused on the persecution or destruction of Jewish people. Working with the spirit of anti-Christ, they have created satanic strategies focused on preventing the Second Coming of Jesus. 

Dr. Morgan shows the significance of aligning with Godâ€™s prophetic purposes for the Church and the Jewish people.  There is a great spiritual battle opposing everyone who confronts anti-Semitism and participates in Godâ€™s purposes for the Church and the Jewish people.

Is there anyone out there who is Jewish, who was attracted to the love of the Jesus Movement, who worked as a teacher in a Pentecostal Christian school, who lived in a Christian commune, who attended a deaf church, who served for years with Jews for Jesus as a volunteer and also a missionary, who spoke in hundreds of churches, who worked for Focus on the Family, who led a cause to expose the ""wrongs"" of Jews for Jesus, who also taught skating for years, who raised her children as secular Jews, who sought G-d in Orthodox Judaism, whose husband almost died in a horrible accident, who unschooled her children, and who became ""sort of famous"" because of her writing about figure skating?

Perhaps Jonah and I also have something in common...

A Distant Dream,Levi Kaufman,Ebook,USD 2.99,"A Distant Dream, an historical novel, is set against the vivid backdrop of Medieval Europe and the religious hostility that was its hallmark. In the year 1290, England's twelve thousand Jews became the continent's first community to face expulsion. Despite oppressive and unfair taxes and restrictive living conditions, the Jews had somehow managed to survive and even prosper. Now they were to be forced to abandon their homes and belongings. Where should the uprooted families go? Would any other Christian nations welcome them? Would they be allowed to remain in any one place for more than a few years? 
Perhaps some tired and idealistic English Jew dreamed of cutting his ancient ties with Europe altogether. Perhaps he spoke to others around him and together, they make plans. Perhaps there were some who dared to set out for some new land where they could live their lives as Jews. Where they could live undisturbed by the outside world...",2012,English,9780973887266,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Levi Kaufman,,,,,EPUB,"['Jews', 'England', 'expulsion', 'island colony', 'community', 'torah']"

Some of the issues dealt with in this book are: What happens after we die? How will God judge people? What is the future of Israel? Who will be let into heaven? What is the mark of the beast?

This has been a peculiarly difficult task where Jews are concerned, for the vision of the world has been obscured by darkly bias-tinted spectacles. If, on the one hand, Christological and anti-Semitic prejudices have revealed only an infamous horde of blasphemers and parasites, on the other, a historical perspective limited by Scripture has disclosed an exalted band of prophets, hounded and persecuted as prophets must be for their vision and temerity. Between these two extremesâ€”which have alike doomed Jews to the unhappiest of careersâ€”a normal people, with all the faults and virtues of humanity, has pursued its normal course through history, however abnormal were the conditions against which it struggled.",2011,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Joshua Trachtenberg,,,,,PDF,"['jewish', 'magic']"
THE MYSTERY OF JEWISH HISTORY,Vladimir Moss,Paperback,USD 27.89,"â€œThe  Jewish  Questionâ€  remains  as  topical  â€“  and  controversial  â€“  as  ever.  Some Orthodox  Christians  speak  and  write  on  little  else,  considering  it  to  be  the  question, the  question  that  everyone  must  understand  if  they  are  to  understand  the  essence of  the  modern  world  and  of  Christian  history  in  general.  They  see  the  fount  of  all evil  in  the  manipulation  of  world  events  by  a  small  sect  of  God-hating  and  manhating  Talmudist  rabbis.  Others  are  shocked  by  this  attitude,  considering  it  to  be anti-semitic,  and  turn  away  in  disgust  whenever  the  subject  is  raised.  They  regard any  such  idea  as  serious  sin,  lack  of  love  and  the  prolongation  of  the  lies  that  incited the  pogroms  and  the holocaust. If  we  turn  to  the  Holy  Scriptures  and  Church  Tradition,  then  we  find  some confirmation  for  both  points  of  view.  On  the  one  hand,  the  Apostle  Paul  calls  the Jews  who  reject  Christ  â€œdogsâ€  (Philippians  3.2);  he  devotes  a  whole  epistle (Galatians),  and  large  parts  of  other  epistles,  to  the  threat  of  the  Judaizers;  and  in general  treats  the  Jews  as  the  main  enemies  of  the  Christians.  On  the  other  hand,  he writes:  â€œHas  God  cast  away  His  people?  God  forbidâ€  (Romans  11.1);  he  warns  the Christian  Gentiles  not  to  boast  or  be  high-minded  in  relation  to  the  Jews,  but  to  fear lest  they  themselves  fall  away  (Romans  11.20);  for  â€œhardness  in  part  has  come  upon Israel  until  the  fullness  of  Gentiles  has  come  in.  And  so  all  Israel  [believing  Jews  and Gentiles  together] shall be savedâ€ (Romans  11.25-26). So  what  is  the  truth  about  the  Jews?  And  what  should  be  our  attitude  towards them?  In  attempting  to  answer  these  questions,  I  shall  adopt  an  historical  approach, beginning  with  the  Jewsâ€™  calling  by  God  through  Abraham  to  become  Godâ€™s  people, the  chosen  race,  until  their  apostasy  from  Christ  in  the  first  century  (parts  I  and  II); continuing  with  the  long  period  in  which  they  lived  primarily  under  Christian rulers  of  one  kind  or  another  (part  III);  then  their  emergence  onto  modern  history after  the  French  revolution  as  an  independent  political  force  to  be  reckoned  with  by all  other  players  (part  IV).",2021,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Vladimir Moss,311,Paperback,Black & White,A4 (8.27 x 11.69 in / 210 x 297 mm),,"['Judaism', 'Orthodox Christianity', 'Jews', 'Church of God', 'Betrayal']"

The Trinity Manifesto,Nigel Shindler,Hardcover,USD 45.46,"The central message ""Love Is the Nature of Existence"" has to convey is an explanation as to what a Jew is, and why The Lord decided to create â€œThe Chosen Peopleâ€.
  The purpose of life as The Bible teaches us, and all other Holy Scriptures, is to join, yoke, become one with God.
  In order for Man to accomplish this feat The Lord chose certain members of the human population to help others cultivate their minds, and by doing so have the same knowledge Adam and Eve had while still in the Garden of Eden.

Perhaps he spoke to others around him and, together, they make plans.  Perhaps there were some who dared to set out for some new land where they could live their lives as Jews.  Where they could live undisturbed by the outside worldâ€¦

Of these, maybe two dozen were hiding within Libau itself. This story is about 12 of them. Eleven adults were in the care of Robert and Johanna Sedols who hid them in a cellar behind a false wall constructed with the ""holy bricks"" of the demolished Choral Synagogue; the lone child was cared for by a widow, Otilija Schimelpfenig, in the secure comfort of her home. For their courage and moral stature, the Sedols and Mrs. Schimelpfenig are memorialized as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" at Yad Vashem. How these 12 Jews arrived at their hiding places, and how they endured until liberation, is a remarkable story, one of miracles.

Epithets fly and confrontations occur across the barricades, but nobody is really listening to each other.
  
Rabbi Gershom seeks to build a bridge of understanding between these two warring camps.  On the one hand, he opposes using live chickens as Kapporos, and, like many other religious Jews before him, advocates giving money to charity instead.

Why Giving Is Better Than Tithing,C.N Chris,Ebook,USD 3.00,"Since God is love, Why would such God wish to curse people who are under grace with a curse, call them robbers and destroy their businesses just because they did not pay tithe to religious houses as the law demands? The law came through Moses, not for the whole world but for the Jews only. The grace came through Jesus Christ, not for the Jews only but for the whole world. So tithe and its curses are Moses Jewish laws, not Jesus laws from God. The only law from God through Jesus is Love. God loves a cheerful giver but tithing is not cheerful.

Tithing is not by cheerful giving but a command with the law of tithe as payment. Those who are afraid of devourers or being called a robber by the God of Malachi can struggle to keep the law of paying tithe yet they are not Jews since sacrifice and tithes are not accepted from the gentiles by the God of Malachi.

The Message,John Thatcher,Paperback,USD 6.28,"Finally, a book about Noadiah - the final  prophet of the Old Testament. Her story compels us to see the days of Ezra and Nehemiah from a new perspective.
They were desolate days in Jerusalem.
The Jews had killed the beloved prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, but Ezra the scribe and Nehemiah the Persian appointed Governor of Judea, omitted his murder from their glorious records reverberating with Jewish lineage and self-praise.
It took the coming of Jesus, the light to the Gentiles, to illuminate the dark acts of the Jews -
""Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, â€˜If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.â€™...upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.""  Matthew 23:29-35
Stephen also said of the Jews -
Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute?
We need to see the history of the Jews through the lens of Jesus. When Nehemiah recorded that Noadiah and all the prophets were trying to intimidate him, were his actions right, or was it Noadiah and the other prophets who were right to oppose him?

Hebrew Salvation,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 20.00,"Many among the Peoples in the West are to a significant degree of Hebrew Descent. In Ancient Times they had separated from Judah (the present-day Jews) and created their own Kingdom. Eventually they were conquered by the Assyrians. They moved via different pathways of migration to the west. The Prophet Hosea in the Bible described the situation today in Western Nations. He also referred to events in the past and in his own time. Megalithic Monuments, such as dolmens, were to be found in the Land of Israel. The Hebrews when they moved westward were told to put such monuments up along their route to serve in the future as evidence of their Hebrew Origins! It was prophesied that the Ten Tribes will re-unite with Judah. Many will return to the Land of Israel. For others the Lands they are now in will become part of the Holy Land! The return will be preceded by a War between the Ten Tribes, headed by Ephraim, and the forces of Edom. The Lost Israelites may have to fight against certain Non-Israelite Nations. Ephraim (i.e. the Ten Tribes of Israel) will repent. Rabbi Moshe David Valle, a Rabbinical Mystic in the 1700s, interpreted passages in the Book of Hosea as saying that Ephraim in the End Times will have completed his task.

Judenhass,Dave Sim,Paperback,USD 8.21,"I decided some time ago that the term anti-Semitism (a 'coined' term of late nineteenth century origin) is completely inadequate to the abhorrent cultural phenomenon which it attempts to describe. For one thing, Arabs are Semites as well and the prejudice as it generally understood certainly doesn't apply equally to Arabs and Jews.

It was in the early stages of researching this graphic narrative that I first encountered the German term Judenhass. Literally, Jew-Hatred. It seemed to me that the term served to distill the ancient problem to its essence, and in such a way as to hopefully allow other non-Jews (like myself) to see the problem 'unlaundered' and through fresh eyes. Europe and various other jurisdictions aren't experiencing a sudden upsurge in 'anti-Semitism'. What they are experiencing is an upsurge in Judenhass -- Jew-Hatred. 

So that's what I've chosen to call this story.

It argues that Paulâ€™s prime concern in Romans is the troubled relationship of Jews and Gentiles in the early church, and specifically in Rome, and it seeks to follow the Apostleâ€™s argument and his attempts to bring the separate groups together in unified worship.

Redemption of the Transgressions,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"When the Roman Republic conquered Judea, they turned it into a Roman province. But, the land of ancient Israel was predominantly Jewish until the Jewishâ€“Roman wars. During the wars, the Roman Empire expelled most of the Jews from that land and formed the Roman province of Syria Palaestina, beginning a new period in Jewish history known as the diaspora. After this time, Jews became a minority in most regions of the land of Israel, except in Galilee. The area became increasingly Christianized after the 3rd century of the resurrection of Christ: Christians dominated in urban areas, and Jews remained in rural areas. Jewish settlements declined by the time of the Muslim conquest of the Levant. Then the forces of the First Crusade conquered Jerusalem and nearby coastal areas, forming the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Over the following 200 years, Crusader forces lost and recaptured Jerusalem until their final ouster from Acre. Then the Holy Land was made part of the Ottoman Empire, and Turks ruled it until the British conquered it. The region was ruled under the British Mandate for Palestine; but the pivotal fulfillment of prophecy came when the Jewish State of Israel was proclaimed in part of the ancient land of Israel. This was made possible by the Zionist movement and its promotion of mass Jewish immigration - and Israel began to flourish again, to prepare God's people for the 21st century...all the while, waiting for the redemption of their transgressions.",2021,English,N/A,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,,,,,EPUB,['faith']

Davidâ€™s Rise to Power,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"David is a living legend of Hebrew history, and this is a presentation of him from a Greek point of view: a view which found its way into the English language. Davidâ€™s rise to power starts with the story of a man of God named Samuel. As a child, Samuel lived in a house of worship. The Lord singled him out as a prophet, and the childâ€™s first prophecy was one of judgment on the corrupt priests. This was when Samuelâ€™s people, the people of Israel, got used to being in constant battles with their most famous enemy, the Philistines. The Philistines capture the ark of the covenant, Messiahâ€™s earthly gift to Israel, but when the Creator sends judgment, the Philistines return the ark. Samuel calls Israel to repentance, and then to victory over the Philistines. But that was not enough for Israel: wanting to be like other nations, they desired a king. Samuel is displeased by their demands, but God the Father tells him that it is not Samuelâ€™s leadership they are rejecting, but his own. After warning the people of what having a king would mean, Samuel anoints a man named Saul. Saul enjoys initial success, but then he makes a series of missteps: he presumptuously offers a sacrifice, he makes a foolish vow at the expense of his son Jonathan, and he disobeys the heavenly Fatherâ€™s direct command.

Amidst Latvians During the Holocaust,Edward Anders,Ebook,USD 1.99,"""ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF 2011"" (Kirkus Reviews). Edward (15) survived the Holocaust by an audacious lie invented by his father: his mother, Erica, would claim to be a German foundling raised by a Jewish family. The ploy didnâ€™t save his father, who was shot along with 98% of the Jews in Latvia, but it gave Erica the provisional status of an Aryan and her two sons that of half-Jews. The scheme became a cat-and-mouse game with skeptical Nazi officials; the family gleaned one temporary reprieve after another as they amassed bogus documentation of German ancestryâ€”the author used his knowledge of chemistry to alter identity papersâ€”always aware that one false step could land them in a mass grave. He tells this harrowing story with absorbing lucidity, with a simple moral visionâ€”â€œI met enough decent, brave, and noble Germans and Latvians during the war to be immunized against prejudiceâ€â€”that resonates. A testament of remarkable clarity and humanity, wrung from dark experience.

Hebrew Destiny,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 20.00,"""Hebrew Destiny"" describes how the Lost Ten Tribes are to be found in Countries of the West. This message needs to be spread. The Prophet  Hosea warned ""Ephraim,"" meaning principally the English-speaking peoples, against the dangers of Islam. Mohamed was described as a ""Mad Prophet."" Hosea foresaw that ""Ephraim"" would attempt to come to an understanding with followers of this person. The consequences are liable to result in disaster. In addition, ""Ephraim"" will be deluded and afflicted due to rampant sexual immorality. Hosea recalls how these same sins led to the Ten Tribes going into Exile. They lost awareness of their ancestry. The Phoenician Edomites of Tyre and the Minoan Sailors of Phillistia under Edomite direction served as agents for Assyria. They set up colonies in the west to work the mines and to grow crops to supply the Assyrian Empire. Israelites were taken in ships as captives to settle in such places. They were also taken overland to other areas. From there too, they came westward. Descendants of Ephraim are still to be found among Western nations and their offshoots. They are called upon to repent. The presence of many from the Lost Ten Tribes in North America in our times had been predicted. Judah will have remained basically faithful. Judah will be called upon to lead the Lost Ten Tribes back.

About the author:

Felix Salten (6 September 1869 â€“ 8 October 1945) was an Austrian author and critic in Vienna. His most famous work is Bambi, a Life in the Woods (1923).Salten was born Siegmund Salzmann in Budapest, Hungary. When he was four weeks old, his family relocated to Vienna, Austria. Many Jews were immigrating into the city during the late 19th century because Vienna had granted full citizenship to Jews in 1867.When his father became bankrupt, the sixteen-year-old Salten quit school and began working for an insurance agency. He also began submitting poems and book reviews to journals. He became part of the ""Young Vienna"" movement (Jung Wien) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic for Vienna's press (Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung, Zeit). In 1900 he published his first collection of short stories.

Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians,Charles Hodge,Ebook,USD 2.99,"In the introduction to his commentary, Charles Hodge investigates the sociopolitical climate of the city of Ephesus prior to Paul's first visit. Ephesus was famous for its idolatrous practices of sorcery and divination. Upon arriving in Ephesus, Paul and his disciples spread the word of Jesus to the wayward Jews and Greeks, and many were converted. A flourishing Church was established, and several years after his visit to Ephesus, Paul wrote to the Ephesians while imprisoned in Rome. Paul wrote this letter to praise God for the gift of redemption and to guide the Christians of Ephesus in the light of the Holy Ghost. Several sections of the epistle focus on godly social interactions. This epistle was in large part intended to encourage unity between newly converted Jews and the rest of the Christian community. Hodge's careful scrutiny gives readers a newly informed look at Paul's letter to the Christians at Ephesus. -Emmalon Davis, CCEL Staff Writer",2010,English,9781610250948,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Charles Hodge,,,,,EPUB,"['ccel', 'christian', 'god', 'christ', 'christianity', 'spirituality', 'classics', 'christian classics', 'ethereal', 'jesus', 'religion', 'commentary', 'hodge', 'ephesus', 'ephesians', 'paul', 'epistle', 'church']"

Rereading Exodus Along the Anacostia  E-Version,Virginia Spatz,Ebook,USD 5.43,"Rereading Exodus along the Anacostia explores intergroup dialogue, its role in understanding and addressing oppression and in envisioning new ways to get ourselves -- all of us -- out from under the millstone of racism and inequality and militarism. This book comes from Jewish tradition and from what We Act Radio calls ""the underbelly of the Nation's Capital.""

Rereading Exodus shares lessons the author has gleaned from DC's Cross River Dialogue, a small group of white Jews, all living west of the Anacostia River, and Black non-Jews living and working east of the river. The hope is that this book can help promote intergroup understanding and address deliberate attempts to weaponize certain topics, across our overlapping Black and Jewish communities.This book is meant to foster crucial conversations and to add layers to Passover observance and reading the Book of Exodus.

Lessons DC teaches about these topics and about Exodus -- and vice versa -- are not specific to one locale. Join the journey to explore connections with other areas...and to learn something about life and struggle in the Nation's Capitol, complete with underbelly.",2022,English,N/A,Social Science,Creative Commons ShareAlike (CC BY-SA),By (author): Virginia Spatz,,,,,PDF,"['Exodus', 'Passover', 'Washington DC']"

Hebrew Warriors,Yair Davidiy,Paperback,USD 40.00,"The ""KHAZARS"" became prominent in southern Russia and its neighborhood in the 600s to 900s CE.  They were  powerful with a far-reaching influence and well-developed civilization. They protected the Jews while giving full citizenship rights to Christians and Moslems who served them faithfully. The ""KHAZARS"" converted to Judaism and henceforth were Jewish.
The Khazars were related to the Picts of Scotland and to other groups who settled in Scandinavia, France, and the British Isles.
Proofs concerning the Israelite origins of the Khazars of necessity also do the same for the nations they were of kinship with.
The Khazars were descended from a mixture of remnants of the Ten Tribes, Jewish refugees whose religious affiliation had blurred, and Gentile descendants of Gomer. A movement to return to Judaism began among them. Due to the uncertainty of their lineages the Rabbis declared them all Gentiles and then converted them to Judaism as the Bible and Tradition allowed them to do.
Descendants of the Khazars may still be found among some Jewish communities but only as a minority element and indistinguishable from other Jews.
Nevertheless, it is both important and of interest to know more about them.
The Khazars are symbolic of the Israelite People in general. It should be worth our while to be aware of this.
Part of the Scottish people descend from the Agathyrsi who were a branch of the Khazars.",2019,English,9781678027179,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Yair Davidiy,218,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Khazars', 'Hebrews', 'Converts', 'Red Jews', 'Agathyrsi', 'Picts', 'Armenia', 'Hungary', 'Central Asia', 'Scaninavia', 'Sweden', 'Birka', 'Archaeology']"

The Message,John Thatcher,Ebook,USD 0.00,"Finally, a book about Noadiah - the final prophet of the Old Testament history books. Her story compels us to see the days of Ezra and Nehemiah from a new perspective.
They were desolate days in Jerusalem.
The Jews had killed the beloved prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, but Ezra the scribe and Nehemiah the Persian appointed Governor of Judea, omitted it from their glorious records reverberating with Jewish lineage and self-praise.
It took the coming of Jesus, the light to the Gentiles, to illuminate the dark acts of the Jews -
""Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, â€˜If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.â€™...upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.""  Matthew 23:29-35
We need to see the history of the Jews through the lens of Jesus. When Nehemiah recorded that Noadiah and all the prophets were trying to intimidate him, were his actions right, or was it Noadiah and the other prophets who were right to oppose him?  
John Thatcher combines a lifetime of Bible study with great insight, to present the closing acts of the Old Testament as a warning to perceive that the things that are of God, and the things that are of men.

There are two rival historical-fiction interpretations of Revelation: ""Left Behind"" by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and ""The Last Disciple"" by Hank Hanegraaff and Sigmund Brouwer.  LaHaye's is futurist, meaning that most of the predictions will happen in the future.  Hanegraaff's is preterist, meaning that many of the predictions have already happened as the Christian Church formed in the first and second centuries.  Hanegraaff's book is handicapped because the average reader can't distinguish the real characters and events from the fictional ones.  I know the history very well because I researched and wrote a preterist interpretation, which I condensed into my present book.  I provide the historical facts of that period and show how the facts relate to Revelation.

Epithets fly and confrontations occur across the barricades, but nobody is really listening to each other. Rabbi Gershom seeks to build a bridge of understanding between these two warring camps. On the one hand, he opposes using live chickens as Kapporos, and, like many other religious Jews before him, advocates giving money to charity instead. But on the other hand, he is himself a Hasid who understands and believes in the kabbalistic principle of ""raising holy sparks"" so central to the ceremony.

How Did A Hebrew Like You Become An Enthusiast of Yeshua?,Rhett Vorster,Ebook,USD 10.00,"This book is my way of saying that Zola Levitt was the best employer I ever had: I say that now because, since my time at Zola's ministry as his worker, God the Son arranged my life in such a way that I no longer had to depend on earthly employers, allowing me to fully engage in my heavenly calling. The reason why I worked for Zola was because he ended up being one of the best teachers I ever knew. I felt it was time to resurrect a story which has been partially hidden for a long time. Zola is dead now, but he is dancing in heaven. That is a big reason why this book before you exists: it is my regenerated version of a publication which first came out the year that the world's population reached about 4 billion souls; it is my prayer that this novel reaches the seemingly fictitious 8 billion souls who live on earth today. What you see here is a slightly modernized rendition of how the Lord of hosts wins hearts through love - but it is not updated for the sake of sophistry; it is retouched in order to bring clarity by means of my calling in the Lord.

Davidâ€™s Rise to Power,Rhett Vorster,Paperback,USD 25.00,"David is a living legend of Hebrew history, and this is a presentation of him from a Greek point of view: a view which found its way into the English language. Davidâ€™s rise to power starts with the story of a man of God named Samuel. As a child, Samuel lived in a house of worship. The Lord singled him out as a prophet, and the childâ€™s first prophecy was one of judgment on the corrupt priests. This was when Samuelâ€™s people, the people of Israel, got used to being in constant battles with their most famous enemy, the Philistines. The Philistines capture the ark of the covenant, Messiahâ€™s earthly gift to Israel, but when the Creator sends judgment, the Philistines return the ark. Samuel calls Israel to repentance, and then to victory over the Philistines. But that was not enough for Israel: wanting to be like other nations, they desired a king. Samuel is displeased by their demands, but God the Father tells him that it is not Samuelâ€™s leadership they are rejecting, but his own. After warning the people of what having a king would mean, Samuel anoints a man named Saul. Saul enjoys initial success, but then he makes a series of missteps: he presumptuously offers a sacrifice, he makes a foolish vow at the expense of his son Jonathan, and he disobeys the heavenly Fatherâ€™s direct command. That is how David shows upâ€¦and if you want to find out what happens next and how it all ended up, you must open this book!",2022,English,9781387559091,Fiction,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Rhett Vorster,108,Paperback,Black & White,US Letter (8.5 x 11 in / 216 x 279 mm),,"['faith', 'hope', 'love', 'David', 'Israel', 'Hebrews', 'Jews', 'kingdom', 'war', 'power']"

Desperately wanting to find his mother, Leo managed to escape from his kidnappers. He was able to join a gypsy camp and he wandered with the gypsies across the Crimea in search of his mother.  In the city of Yalta, a noblewoman who wanted to keep him as her son abducted Leo, but the desire to find his mother was stronger than the comforts of a wealthy estate, and Leo escaped to the wilderness of the Crimean Mountains. There the Crimean Tatars saved him from starvation, and they helped him to make the journey to the city of Karasubazar to meet with Jewish traders who helped him in his search.  Finally, Leo achieved his goal and found his mother, but that is not the end of the story.â€¦",2013,English,9781312066601,History,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Viktor Shel,,,,,EPUB,"['Viktor Shel', 'Russian Empire', 'Crimean peninsula', 'Russians', 'Gypsies', 'Jews']"
