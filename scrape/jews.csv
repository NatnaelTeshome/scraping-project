Becoming the friend of Titus, and despairing of the success of his compatriots, he was employed in efforts to conciliate the leaders of the rebellion during the siege, and he was for three years a privileged captive in the camp of the besiegers.

THE LEGENDS OF THE JEWS (1909),LOUIS GINZBERG TRANSLATED BY HENRIETTA SZOLD,Ebook,USD 2.00,"The term Rabbinic was applied to the Jewish Literature of 
post-Biblical times by those who conceived the Judaism of the
later epoch to be something different from the Judaism of the
Bible, something actually opposed to it. Such observers held that
the Jewish nation ceased to exist with the moment when its
political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the
later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of
which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of
Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the
product of the schools rather than the product of practical,
pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings
of morbid visionaries, is the material out of which these
scholars construct the theologic system of the Rabbis, and fairy
tales, the spontaneous creations of the people, which take the
form of sacred legend in Jewish literature,",2011,English,N/A,Religion & Spirituality,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): LOUIS GINZBERG TRANSLATED BY HENRIETTA SZOLD,,,,,PDF,['LEGENDS OF  JEWS']

Print Wikipedia is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture towards the inhuman scale of big data. Michael Mandberg wrote software that parses the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out nearly 7500 volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them to Lulu.com for print-on-demand. Print Wikipedia draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of date. It is also a work of found poetry built on what is likely the largest appropriation ever made. As we become increasingly more dependent on information and source material on the Internet today, Mandiberg explores the accessibility of its vastness.",2015,English,9781329283336,Poetry,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Print Wikipedia,701,Hardcover,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Poetry', 'Reference', 'Wikipedia', 'Mandiberg']"
