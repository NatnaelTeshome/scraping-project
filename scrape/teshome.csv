The Economics of the Invisible Global Good-Governance Government and the Aid-Dependent Economy,Teshome Mulat,Paperback,USD 13.16,"Irrespective of source and manner of aid management, any aid received by a non-good-governance government above the food-aid threshold tends to increase transaction cost toward infinity (transaction cost theorem).

Under the new dispensation of the global good-governance government, which came into a clear profile after the global economy meltdown and the environmental crises, that level of food-aid is now unconditionally received as human right. This monograph concludes that of all the major problems global good-governance government is confronted with today, the problem of the aid-dependent economy is perhaps the easiest and the least costly to solve.",2010,English,9780557184927,Business & Economics,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Teshome Mulat,104,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Good-governance government', 'aid-dependent economy', 'transaction cost theorem', 'food-aid conditionality', 'private property development']"
