""In a small village in China, the Wang family has produced seven sisters in its quest to have a boy; three of the sisters emerge as the lead characters in this remarkable novel. From the small-town treachery of the village to the slogans of the Cultural Revolution to the harried pace of city life, Bi Feiyu follows the women as they strive to change the course of their destinies and battle against an “infinite ocean of people” in a China that does not truly belong to them. Yumi will use her dignity, Yuxiu her powers of seduction, and Yuyang her ambition—all in an effort to take control of their world, their bodies, and their lives.

Like Dai Sijie’s Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, Arthur Golden’s Memoirs of a Geisha, and J.G. Ballard’s Empire of the Sun, Three Sisters transports us to and immerses us in a culture we think we know but will understand much more fully by the time we reach the end. Bi’s Moon Opera was praised by the Los Angeles Times, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and other publications ...""

Bi Feiyu's works are also known for their complex portrayal of the female psyche. He has won some of the highest literary awards in China. He also wrote the screenplay for Zhang Yimou's 1996 film Shanghai Triad.

So this is certainly another cool book about China :)

Indeed, my dear old friend, the Golden Dragon 'Pyrite' - who happens to be the Guardian Dragon of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] - found this novel to be very entertaining and factual about Communist China in the 1970's.

However, the story was also a bit sad, highlighting the psycho-historical trauma that Mao's failed Cultural Revolution inflicted on China - which caused a lot of heart-break, human rights abuses and petty rivalries among the People.

Regrettably, rigid hierarchies in the CCP are still responsible for human rights abuses in today's China.

Hence we encourage the Chinese Communist Party to give up their monopoly on power, and implement Universal Suffrage in China; so that other political parties can also be elected in national elections and participate in governing China.

On that note, we would like to remind all People in China that human evolution is a constant in the Universe.

This has led to a new mass exodus, leading to hundreds of thousands of people leaving Bosnia and Herzegovina each year. Social exclusion and discrimination – in particular of Roma, LGBT people and people with disabilities – also remained widespread in 2018, despite the adoption of a progressive Law on Prevention of Discrimination in 2016.

Violations of press freedoms are also a major problem in the country; with 41 attacks against journalists having been reported since 2018, including five death threats, seven physical attacks, and eight direct threats by politicians – indicating an overall lack of rule-of-law and democracy in the country.

Hence Rule of Law, Human Rights and Economic Stability must improve in Bosnia and Herzegovina; so that Peace and Prosperity can be manifested in this beautiful country.

PS: The NGO BTB-GLOBAL PEACEBUILDING and the Holy Sea - with all its friends, resources, and other assets - is giving the order to implement out of the ordinary measures to restore Peace and Harmony in the International Community. This includes a governmental change in Russia and bringing Vladimir Putin to Justice; as stipulated by the International Criminal Court (ICC).

In our opinion, bringing Vladimir Putin to Justice would be the right thing to do - and make him resign from office - so that International Human Rights Law (IHRL) can be restored in the world.

We are also advocating that Russian lawmakers, military officers and civil servants should receive an Amnesty, who participate in restoring Peace between Russia and Ukraine.

A continuation of Russia's war in Ukraine will increasingly harm Russia’s reputation in the world, and isolate the Russian people economically, socially and culturally – which is unnecessary and can be avoided, if Russia restores peaceful relations with the International Community, which would include the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.

Once Peace between Russia and Ukraine has been manifested, we intend to replace NATO with a new International Peacebuilding Alliance (IPA) - where both Russia and the US will have a key and instrumental role.

We would like to emphasize, that we are expecting both Russia and the United States to fall in line with this new International Peacebuilding Policy.

Once Peace and Prosperity has been restored in the world, I will be quite happy to step down as world leader.

But until we reach that stage of Peace and Harmony in the International Community, I suggest we all pull in the same direction :)

We are also advocating the founding of a world organization that is above all other governments - even above the UK, Russia and the US - so that Peace and Prosperity can be manifested in the world.

Until Peace on Earth has been manifested, it will be the NGO BTB-Global Peacebuilding which will handle matters - such as bringing the UK, Russia and the United States into a new International Peacebuilding Alliance (IPA).

The aim would be, to convince both the US and Russia to work together towards complete denuclearization and world peace - which I am sure will happen in due course of time - provided that we all work together and trust each other, and believe that Peace on Earth is possible.

PS: We also would be willing to inspect nuclear submarines - in particular from the UK, Russia and the United States - to ensure that gender equality, good etiquette and gentlemanly conduct is upheld on all hunter-killer submarines, that sail across the Seven Seas :)

God Bless / Бог благословил / Бог благословить / Love and Light

Having committed electoral fraud, Alexander Lukashenko is responsible for blatant human rights violations in Belarus. Images of bloody injuries and videos of police attacking people with batons, rubber bullets, stun grenades, and water cannons flooded the airwaves after the sham election in Belarus on 9 August 2020.

More than 6,000 people were arrested over four nights of largely peaceful protest that followed Lukashenko’s fraudulent elections; countless protestors having been beaten and abused in prison. 

And as more prisoners are released, it has become clear that appalling conditions, abuse and torture have been widespread. 

Furthermore, the KGB security police has been accused of kidnapping and threatening to kill the Belarusian opposition politician Maria Kolesnikova.

She was one of seven people on the board of a coordination council set up to transfer power away from Lukashenko. All except the Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich have either been imprisoned or deported.

Maria Kolesnikova’s complaint included the names and ranks of individual officers of the KGB and the organised crime agency whom she accuses of kidnapping and threatening to kill her.

Hence it is imperative that individuals and organizations responsible of committing blatant human rights violations in Belarus are brought to justice – so that rule of law and democracy can be restored in the country.

Also, EU foreign ministers have taken the first steps toward imposing sanctions on top officials in Belarus as protests continue to sweep the country; the EU’s 27 leaders stating that the bloc did not recognize the results of the fraudulent elections. 

It should be noted, that foreign observers have not declared a Belarusian election free and fair since 1995; Mr. Lukashenko having established an effective dictatorship since 1994, sustaining his tyrannical grip on Belarus by shamelessly rigging elections. 

Hence the International Community is advised to keep a safe distance from the Lukashenko Government, until it has agreed to improve itself – by implementing a peaceful and democratic transition in Belarus; so that rule of law, democracy and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) can be restored in Belarus.

REGARDING: Acting President and Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces orders the Kremlin, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and GRU to oust Vladimir Putin and make Peace with Ukraine.

Dear Comrades of the Russian Navy,

Today is a great day! As of today the Acting President of Russia - Mark O'Doherty - has taken over the command of the Russian Navy - bringing Russia into a New Age of Peace and Prosperity.

It should also be noted, that I am currently both the Acting President of the United States, as well as the acting president of Russia. (Since both Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin have agreed to make way, so that I can steer both Russia and the US through these troubled waters - if you will pardon the pun:)  

So it will be only a matter of time before we make Peace with our neighbours in Ukraine :)

Hence it is imperative that Diplomacy and Dialogue is restored between Russia and Ukraine - so that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) can be restored in the world - and Freedom of the Press will be restored in Russia.

On that note, we encourage all People in the Russian Navy to join us in Meditation and Prayer to manifest Peace on Earth - in particular in Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Ukraine.
 
God Bless / Бог благословил / Бог благословить / Love and Light

Acting President of Russia, the United Kingdom, China, European Union and the United States:

Mark / BTB-Global Peacebuilding / Президент Российской Федерации
25. April 2023

PS: We also would be willing to inspect nuclear submarines - in particular from the UK, Russia and the United States - to ensure that Gender Equality, Etiquette and gentlemanly conduct is upheld on all hunter-killer submarines, that sail across the Seven Seas :)

The people of Thailand have endured severe human rights violations since the 2014 coup. The military junta under Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha has banned political activity and public assembly, enforced media censorship, arbitrarily arrested dissidents, and detained civilians in military facilities. Authorities have used lese majeste (insulting the monarchy), sedition, and computer crime charges to suppress free speech; according to Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. Over three million migrant workers face systematic abuse and exploitation, including in the fishing industry, despite government promises for reform. Also, police violence and politically motivated legal harassment by Thai law enforcement against pro-democracy protesters in Thailand is increasing on a horrific scale; the culture of abuse of power, corruption and intimidation in the Thai police force being complex and steeped in the patronage system within and beyond Thai law enforcement. Students say they have been harassed by the authorities with some reporting that they have been held for hours, and pressured into no longer taking part in protests. So the Thai Police - under the authority of Police Gen. Chakthip Chaijinda, Commissioner Sarawut Karnpanit, Pol Maj Gen Sukhun Prommayon, Pol Maj Gen Piya and Col Kissana Phathanacharoen - must simply do better to counter and prevent police violence, corruption and intimidation in Thailand. Also, according to the NGO Amnesty International, military officials in Thailand exercise abusive law enforcement powers; including holding individuals in unofficial places of detention and without charge. A number of detainees were held incommunicado. A man who had sued seven police officers for allegedly torturing him faced trial on counter-charges of perjury filed by one of the officers. So the government of Thailand – as well as the Judiciary of Thailand – must make a greater effort to improve fundamental freedoms in Thailand; such as freedom of speech and freedom of association; being both an individual right and a collective right, and guaranteed by all modern and democratic legal systems. Hence it is imperative that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is upheld and protected in Thailand; so that fundamental freedoms, civil liberties and democracy can be implemented in Thailand.",2020,English,9781716660276,Law,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): Mark O'Doherty,,,,,EPUB,"['""Thailand protesters \'cross the Rubicon\' and risk all to criticise the monarchy""', 'Anger has been building since 2014 coup in which prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power, with students now holding rallies almost daily', 'Thai protesters have broken a long-standing taboo, risking lengthy jail terms to criticise the king, after weeks of student-led pro-democracy rallies that have swept across the country.', 'High school and university students have targeted the government of prime minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha, calling for its dissolution and for democratic reforms.', ""Protesters have begun openly criticising the country's wealthy and powerful monarchy"", 'Amnesty International Thailand', '""Disappearances, torture, and investigations into attacks against political opponents""', 'Activists, academics, opposition politicians, and human rights defenders were arrested, detained and prosecuted for peacefully expressing their views on the government and monarchy.', 'Thailand: Human Rights Watch', 'The military junta under Prime Minister Gen.

Marina Silva said Brazil now had the chance to build “a new democratic ecosystem” in which conservation, sustainability and the climate crisis will take centre stage after Jair Bolsonaro’s era of Amazon destruction.

“It’s so sad to know that many people who dreamed of this moment and fought for this moment are no longer here. That is what lies behind this great effort to honour them,” said Silva, an Amazon-born environmentalist who was Lula’s environment minister from 2003 until 2008 and was recently elected to congress.

Silva paid tribute to Phillips and the Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, who were killed in the Amazon in June – a crime that shocked the world and exposed the environmental catastrophe playing out under Bolsonaro.

“This is a long-running struggle and lamentably Chico Mendes, Sister Dorothy [Stang], Dom Phillips, Bruno and all those who have fallen as part of this struggle [are no longer with us],” said Silva, who also honoured the Indigenous and environmental activists killed during Bolsonaro’s administration.

In his first speech as president, Lula pledged to make the environment one of his government’s top priorities, telling journalists: “We are going to fight for zero deforestation in the Amazon.”

Lula, who managed to dramatically reduce deforestation during his two-term government, said Brazil would retake a lead role in the fight against the climate crisis and that he was open to international collaboration to protect its environment.

Norway’s environment minister said the Amazon Fund – a billion-dollar international kitty designed to support Amazon protection efforts – would be reactivated, having been frozen as a result of the “head-on collision with Bolsonaro” over deforestation.

Lula is expected to send a high-level delegation to next month’s Cop27 climate summit in Egypt.

“Brazil and the planet need the Amazon alive,” Lula told reporters, vowing to crack down on illegal mining, logging and ranching.

One standing tree is worth more than tons of wood that are illegally extracted by those who think only of easy profits.

Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities and armed forces have committed multiple war crimes in the form of deliberate attacks against civilian targets, massacres of civilians, torture and rape of women and children, and indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas.

As many as 300,000 people have been killed or injured in the war so far; including 1,000 Ukrainian children.

Hence it is imperative that Peace is restored between Ukraine and Russia, to stop the killing of Children.

A continuation of Putin's illegal war on Ukraine would increasingly harm Russia's reputation, and isolate the Russian People economically, socially and culturally – which is unnecessary and can be avoided, if Russia restores peaceful relations with the world.

This includes the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory; and restoring Freedom of Speech, Press, Association and Liberty in Russia.

This involves working together with my dear friends António Guterres, Volker Türk, Charles Michel, Ursula Leyen, Joe Biden, Avril Haines, Xi Jinping, Wang Yi, Tony Blinken, Rishi Sunak, James Cleverly, Giorgia Meloni, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Alexei Navalny, Emmanuel Macron, Liz, Boris, Richard, Mike, Nikolai Patrushev, Pope Francis, Igor, Alexander, Valery Gerasimov, Sergey Surovikin, Alexander Schallenberg and William Burns - so that Peace Talks can commence.

It should also be noted that the borders of both Ukraine and Russia have been internationally recognized and defined in 1991 - with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin recognizing Ukraine's independence.

Hence Russia should honour this agreement.

We encourage the People of Russia to restore International Human Rights Law (IHRL) by implementing a governmental change in Russia - which includes replacing Vladimir Putin with a new Russian President, and withdrawing all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.

PS: Once Peace between Russia and Ukraine has been manifested, we intend to replace NATO with a new International Peacebuilding Alliance.

In our opinion this should have been done already after the Cold War, but which the US and EU neglected to do, missing the opportunity of a potential reconciliation with Russia - which the US and EU should rectify.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says more US-Russian prisoner exchanges are possible if Moscow and Washington find a compromise.

On Thursday, WNBA star and two-time Olympian Brittney Griner was freed in a prisoner swap for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.

Asked after a summit in Kyrgyzstan whether other prisoners could be swapped, Putin replied that “everything is possible,” adding that “compromises have been found” that cleared the way for Thursday’s exchange.

“We aren’t refusing to continue this work in the future,” Putin said.

American officials continue to work relentlessly to bring home Paul Whelan, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison after he was convicted of espionage – charges he denies.

“We will not relent until they are reunited with their loved ones,” Blinken said.

A day after Washington and Moscow successfully negotiated the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, the White House has said that the US will work with Russia to gain the release of Paul Whelan, who has been jailed for nearly four years.

John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, told reporters in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comment that further prisoner swaps are possible: “We’re going to be actively working through those channels to try to bring Paul home.”

Hence a prisoner swap needs to be arranged so that both Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich can be freed.
 
To uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), we encourage both Washington and Moscow to arrange a prisoner exchange - so that Paul Whelan and Journalist Evan Gershkovich can be freed, and be reunited with their loved ones.

The United Nations has verified more than a hundred cases of rape or sexual assaults in Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to a UN report.

Also, four visits by the ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, over the past year have led to a ruling that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Vladimir Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for child abductions in Ukraine.

Hence Vladimir Putin should comply with the International Criminal Court and the ICC arrest warrant against him - by going to the ICC out of his own accord and face the charges brought against him.

As many as 300,000 people have been killed or injured in the war so far; including 1,000 Ukrainian children.

So it is imperative that Peace is restored between Ukraine and Russia, to stop the killing of Children.

It should also be noted that the borders of both Ukraine and Russia have been internationally recognized and defined in 1991 - with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin recognizing Ukraine's independence.

Hence Russia should honour this agreement.

We encourage the People of Russia to restore Peace, by withdrawing all troops from Ukrainian territory, and making Vladimir Putin resign from office, so that Peace Talks can commence.

In the name of Humanity we must restore International Human Rights Law, so that Peace can be restored in the world.

We expect our colleagues in Russia to make Peace with Ukraine - and uphold the Legacy of Peace of Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin - by encouraging Vladimir Putin to resign from office.

It should also be noted, that sources in the GRU, FSB and SVR say a military coup is going to happen in Russia.

Also, Gleb Karakulov, who served as a captain in the Federal Protection Service (FSO), tells that Vladimir Putin has gone insane, having lost touch with the world.

Hence we encourage Valery Gerasimov, Yevgeny Prigozhin, Dmitry Utkin and Sergei Shoigu to arrange a peaceful governmental change in Russia.

We may also need our fellow Global Citizens in the Russian Armed Forces to help out, and implement a governmental change in Russia, by bringing Vladimir Putin to Justice - so that International Human Rights Law (IHRL) can be restored in the world.

Indeed, this is also the reason why the NGO BTB-GLOBAL PEACEBUIDING was able to take over the UK government in a jiffy :) Because the UK was like a lost puppy, which needed protection and guardianship by the NGO community.

However, now that we have a competent leader in the UK again - namely my dear friend Rishi Sunak - I will make a tactical retreat from the UK, and leave the country to its own devices. In a similar way that Julius Caesar left the UK, after his famous line: ""Veni, vidi, vici"" - I came; I saw; I conquered :)

So farewell my dear English friends; I am sure one day we will meet again. In this world, or the next :)
But in my heart, you will exist forever, my dear English friends!

Just like the spirit of Britain will, being eternally bonded with my own soul.

In the words of Merlin the Sorcerer, 'This world is done with me; I have remained in this one for far too long. Farewell, cruel universe! It is time for me to move on to the next world.'

My last words to ALL the people of the world are, that anybody who has a pure and virtuous heart can draw the magic sword from the stone - and conquer evil, by bringing Love and Light to the world.

In today's world the magical sword - Excalibur - is especially the gender angle and the freedom of expression angle; which gives the wielder of Excalibur a cutting edge that is very powerful and omniscient indeed :)

So the gender angle can be used in three ways: 1. Utilizing the male power, 2. Utilizing the feminine power and 3. Synergizing both the Yin and the Yang.

Every person has these energies and gender entities inside of him; which can also be boosted with the help of the Cosmic and the Angels.

Invoking the help of Angels and Fairies is something very British indeed - which our ancestors have already done when the world was still young.

NB: It is imperative to manifest necessary measures and laws against poverty, pollution, corruption, racism, apartheid, inequality, gender violence, tyranny and war crimes in the world.

In particular in countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Africa, Korea, India, Russia, Israel, England and China - so that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) can be manifested in the International Community.

We can make real progress toward ending cancer as we know it.

It will take all of us doing our part.  Join us.

Ending cancer as we know it will take all of us doing our part.

We know that the best ideas, the stories that will inspire change, and the actions that can help deliver on this bold mission come from across the United States and beyond. 

President Biden is calling, on the:

- Scientific community to bring its boldest thinking to this fight;
 
- Medical and public health community to improve their outreach to and support for under-served communities, to help patients and families have the best experience possible while living with and surviving cancer, and to improve patient outcomes;
 
- Private sector to step up — to develop and test new treatments, to share more data and knowledge, and to collaborate on tools that can benefit all Americans; and
 
- People living with cancer and survivors, their caregivers and families,  and those who have lost someone to keep sharing their perspectives and experiences and to keep pushing for progress.

The goals and priorities for the Cancer Moonshot must be informed by those with direct experience with cancer. 

Please share your ideas for how we can focus these efforts — and your stories of inspiration and knowledge from your experience with cancer.

From Hong Kong to Beijing to the Great Wall, from the exotic wonders of the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City, to squalid village huts, the dramatic struggle rages across the Celestial Kingdom. This is the story of the Chinese people, high and low, and the Westerners who came to exploit the riches of their ancient land and culture.

We meet a young village wife struggling with the rigid traditions of her people, Manchu empresses and warriors, powerful eunuchs, fanatical Taiping and Boxer Rebels, savvy Chinese pirates, artists, concubines, scoundrels and heroes, well-intentioned missionaries and the rapacious merchants, diplomats and soldiers of the West. Fortunes will rise and fall, loves will be gained and lost [...]"" 

So this is certainly a cool book about China :) 

Indeed, my dear old friend, the Golden Dragon 'Pyrite' - who happens to be the Guardian Dragon of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] - found this novel to be very entertaining and factual about China.

Especially the Empress Dowager Cixi was described very accurately - who was responsible for numerous effective reforms – including the abolition of slavery and ancient torturous punishments.

On that note, we would like to remind all politicians in China and England that human evolution is a constant in the Universe. Just like Ancient Rome and the imperial dynasties of China had to make way for Liberty and Social Justice, so will inequality and classism make way for the English Republic :)

We would like to remind all People in China and England, that the importance of belonging to humankind takes precedence over all the marks of distinction that may separate one person from another.

Our Russian Cosmonauts will land on Mars pretty soon - ahead of the United States. Russia's spacecraft ""Sputnik-Osiris 9"" will land on Mars by 2029 - which will make Russia once more the leader in the world.

As soon as Russia lands on Mars we will implement Terraforming technology - to transform Mars into a habitable planet by using innovative technology to raise temperature, create a breathable atmosphere, and make oceans of water - with the assistance of my dear friends from NASA and SpaceX, who will make sure that Terraforming technology will be up to speed by that time.

However, it should also be noted that the Russian Mars Mission will be very expensive.

So we need to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, to have the necessary funds to implement the Russian Mars Mission.

This includes the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.

We encourage all Russian troops to return home to their loved ones in Russia, so that Peace on Earth can be manifested, and we can focus on taking Humanity into a peaceful and promising future.

PS: For those of my colleagues who did not quite catch the subtle poetic allusion - namely that terraforming the planet Mars is also very much connected to harmonizing the god of war - allow me to clarify.

The god of war is currently ruling Russia - with Russian forces being responsible for the vast majority of human rights violations in Putin's illegal war on Ukraine.

It should also be noted, that Vladimir Putin is responsible for multiple war crimes in the form of deliberate attacks against civilian targets, massacres of civilians and torture and rape of women and children.

Hence Russia is currently dominated by the god of war - personified by the Putin regime - which needs to be replaced by a new government, so that Peace can be restored between Russia and Ukraine.

Psychologically, this may also be the reason why humanity has a strong inclination to explore Mars - in the sense, that the people on Earth have the subconscious desire to harmonize Mars, so that Peace and Harmony can finally be manifested on Earth.

On that note, we would like to encourage all people in the world - regardless whether they are aligned to Venus or Mars - to join us in Meditation and Prayer to manifest Peace on Earth.

Love and Light / Бог благословил / Бог благословить / God Bless
