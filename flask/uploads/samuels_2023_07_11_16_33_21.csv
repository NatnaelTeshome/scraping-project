Between 1938 and 1939, a movement that became known as Kindertransport evacuated nearly 10,000 Jewish children from Germany to Britain. 
Most of the children were between ages 4 and 17; 
some were babies carried by children; none were accompanied by parents. In its particulars, the play Kindertransport is about a fictional child who was evacuated from Germany. It is about separation, 
about the choices we make in our attempts to keep our children safe, and about the reverberations of traumatic events through generations of a family.

This is actually the second edition of a previously published work. Much of the contents of my book from 2010 is still in this book. The editing is different. And I have added some context, and small bit of additional content to this book.

My approach to writing about relationships is somewhat ""meta"". I like to go into the root of the contemporary thinking and behavior that leads to the results we seem to typically get. ""What Women Should Should Know About Men"" is mainly the roots of what has made males behavior in the ways males do, and what women need to know to get better outcomes from their relationships with men.

Many of the things that people are talking about today, I was talking about more than 15 to 20 years ago. Some of which I published in my 2010 book. So. Some of what you read in this book may sound familiar. I am not repeating anything said by some of the contemporary speakers on the subject. Nor am I a student of their work. I have however, studied and observed many people who speak on male/female relationships dynamics. Whether it be the late Kevin Samuels, Trent Sheldon, Tony Gaskin, Steve Harvey, to the much reviled Andrew Tate, my thoughts, observations concerning male/female relationships and dynamics, predates their published thinking on these issues. For a variety of reasons, the aforementioned named men found greater notoriety with the rise of social media, and their masterful use of the platforms. Steve Harvey is was already a media mogul by the time he published his book and subsequent movies by the same name. 
So as you read this book you may read some familiar sounding themes. However, I give a different perspective than most of those known to have shared their thoughts and observations on the subject.",2023,English,9798218154486,Personal Growth,All Rights Reserved - Standard Copyright License,By (author): ANTONIO ALACENA,272,Paperback,Black & White,US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm),,"['Relationships', 'dating', 'sex', 'women and men', 'men', 'women', 'sexual history', 'what men want']"

Little is known about John.  By 1820 he lived in Wharton Township, Fayette Co., Pennsylvania, with an unknown wife and 1 child.  By ca 1836 he was likely dead leaving at least 9 children.  Margaret, Robert and Thomas Stewart are named as his children in the 1831 tax record, but only because John was too poor to pay the school tax.  Daughter, Lydia Stewart's descendants were proven by DNA matches to me.  The other 5 children remain a mystery that I someday hope to solve, along with his parentage.  This book is a record of the descendants of the four known children.  It has a strong emphasis on my parents, Stanley and Marie Downs Tatum and our upbringing in the wonderful community of Samuels, Nelson Co., Kentucky.  I have included lots of family pictures.  It has a chapter on the ice pick / stone hammer murderess, Geneva Chapman Prather, who planned and participated in the murder of her father, Justice George W. Chapman, for financial gain in 1938.  My mother worked for the jailer as live-in help and had to endure spending her nights in the same bedroom with Mrs. Prather.  There were no separate quarters in the jail for women.  How much rest would you get sleeping in the same room with an ice pick murderess?  The research that went into this book is a culmination of years of family study.  My mother was orphaned at 13 months of age.  I encountered many ""genealogy brick walls"" moving back in her line to John Stewart.  The genealogy trails of his four known children have taken me through PA, KY, TN, WV, VA, MO, TX and CA.
